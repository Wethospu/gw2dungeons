(BAD) IDEAS:
 - general description for a dungeon explaining where it is, what to get there, what's usually and so on
   * Wiki should explain this pretty well
 - General profession page to give info about utility skills and how to play.
   * Dulfy guides are up
 - visualize animations and attacks (gifs are quite big but possible)
   * Takes lots of bandwidth and work
 - DataCreator should merge all css and js to one css and js file (and optimize variables, spaces)
   * With caching not much difference
 - Add debug mode to DataCreator (prevents file merging and ads)
   * No need without above feature
 - make translation apply to gw2dungeons-search.js!
   * No one doing translations so not needed.
 - Support for translating images (image names change per translation?)
   * No one doing translations so not needed.
 - Check which image files translations are using and decide which way is right (and either fix or remove useless files).
   * No one doing translations so not needed.
