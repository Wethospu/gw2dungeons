<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol>
	<li>For a record to be valid, the time must be faster than the current record displayed and the record must be accompanied by a video for evidence/proof; one point of view is sufficient.
		<ol type="a"> 
			<li>Videos may not be sped up or slowed down, and must be captured in normal time.</li>
			<li>You must display the game build at some point in your video to show when your run was done. This can be done before, during, or after the run. You can do this by showing your F11 (options) menu at some point in your video.</li>
			<li>There must be at least one PoV that shows what's going on within the dungeon, from start to finish. If at any point there is no video evidence of activities within the run, it'll be denied.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>No use of hacks or 3rd party software that allows players to perform acts that would be impossible without said means. This includes but is not limited to speed hacks, fly hacks, no-clip, teleporting.</li>
	<li>The records timer starts when any party member activates a skill or moves their model. This includes but is not limited to: taking a step, turning, jumping, etc. Using emotes will not result in the timer starting.</li>
	<li>The timer stops when the final boss of the dungeon has been killed.</li>
	<li>All pathways that are designed to block progress through the path must be opened. You may not have any party member(s) get past blocked passages until the required sequence/dialogue has been completed.</li>
	<li>Consumables (excluding food/nourishment) and costume brawl items are banned. Use of any of these will result in your record being denied. This includes mini-pets.
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Event items such as the birthday blaster and other items are banned out of fairness of availability.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>If any party member(s) at any point enter 'out of bounds' on a dungeon map, the time will be void.</li>
	<li>Party members may not abuse blink/teleport skills to manipulate rush abilities. e.g Fiery Greatsword Rush.</li>
	<li>All racial skills are banned from all records due to potential unfair advantages during the entire run or for a specific encounter.</li>
	<li>Party members may not abuse trait swapping to refresh ability cooldowns. e.g. Mesmer Blink, Guardian Wall of Reflection.</li>
	<li>If it is evident that your party has deliberately (or otherwise) abused positioning to disable a boss, your time will be void. This means safe spotting a boss, line of sighting to cause a boss to break, etc.
		<ol type="a">
			<li>Deliberate abuse of event scripts is prohibited. This includes but is not limited to manipulating event spawns, disabling event mechanics, etc. All cutscenes within a dungeon that are relevant to the path must be triggered.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>The record system is founded on trust. Please do not attempt to fake videos, i.e.: Editing them, using DC tricks to manipulate the in-game events, etc. All we have is third-party proof and no real way to verify your accomplishments. Because of this, some people may, and will fake records. If a record appears to be fake, feel free to follow up with your own posts in its thread debating its legitimacy.</li>
	<li>No use of gem store boosters/items. This includes but is not limited to Strength boosters and Armour Boosters.</li>
	<li>Party members may not switch character once the timer has begun.</li>
	<li>Any disputes will be handled at GWSCR staffs discretion. Staff decisions are final.</li>
	<li>Have fun, and good luck</li>
</ol>
<p>*** These rules are subject to change at any time so it is advised you brief yourself with them each time before you post a record. ***</p>
