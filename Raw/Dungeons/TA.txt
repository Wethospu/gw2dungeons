tactic=normal
2 enemy=Recluses spawn right before the first door. After them there are 2 more enemy=Recluses, 12 enemy=Spider_Hatchlings and 5 enemy=Sylvari_Prisoners.
Prisoners can be rescued by activating their pod. There is a high chance (~50%) that they are already corrupted which makes a random enemy=text:Nightmare_Court_Initiate|knight|duelist|sorcerer|archer appear. If they are not corrupt, they will give you a buff which heals you right before you get downed.
Unfortunately you shouldn't save any prisoners because most of them are corrupted and the gained buff is neglible. If you want to save them, do it after all other enemies are dead so you won't get overrun.
After the area there is a enemy=Duelist and a enemy=Sorcerer. After them there is an enemy=Archer, a enemy=Knight and a enemy=Sylvari_Prisoner. At end of the corridor there are 3 enemy=Spell_Blossoms and 2 enemy=Archers_(Stable).
After them there are 4 enemy=Volatile_Blossoms. They are traps which will kill you fast if you stand on them. Use ranged multitarget attacks to clear them in few hits. Keep in mind that Blossoms will respawn after a short time so don't wait near them.
After blossoms, enemy=Undergrowth_Spider_Queen:champion will spawn so wait for others right after blossoms.
tactic=skip
Just run through.

media=tas_skip1.jpg|Watch out for the 2 spawning enemy=Undergrowth_Recluses. Stack a short stealth with a wiki=Black_Powder and 3 wiki=Cluster_Bomb|Cluster_Bombs before you trigger them. At the big area, stack a longer stealth with a wiki=Smoke_Screen and 6 wiki=Cluster_Bomb|Cluster_Bombs.
Stack more stealth after first nightmare court enemies with a wiki=Black_Powder and 3 wiki=Cluster_Bomb|Cluster_Bombs. If no one helps with blasting, use also wiki=Blinding_Powder. The stealth should last almost to end which is enough to get everyone through.
Take also wiki=Shadow_Refuge so you can use it for stealth if people aggro enemies. It's possible to stand between enemy groups even media=tas_skip2.jpg|without_stealth if you need to wait for cooldowns.

tactic=ranged|melee
Watch out for nearby enemy=Volatile_Blossoms on the area. 4 enemy=Spider_Hatchlings:normal constantly respawn on the area.
tactic=ranged
| Use area attacks to bring them down while attacking Queen.
tactic=melee
| Use cleaving attacks to bring them down while attacking the Queen.
tactic=ranged
Stay at range to avoid her melee Bite. She may occasionally leap towards you. Just move away from her if that happens.
Pay attention when she is glowing. She will shoot projectiles which immobilize for a long time so focus on blocking or evading them.
Take party wide condition removal to help or anyone else who gets hit by the immobilize attack.
tactic=melee
Stay behind her back so you know when she is going to attack you. Try to block or evade her melee attack.
Be ready to dodge when she glows. She will shoot 3 projectiles in a cone each immobilize for a long time. At close range you may get hit by all of them and take lots of damage.
Take 1-2 condition removals to remove immobilize if you get hit. Also remove weakness from her melee Bite if possible.
tactic=ranged|melee
If you get downed, rally off from a Hatchling or Blossom.
tactic=thief
wiki=Pistol_Whip with wiki=Invigorating_Precision and wiki=Signet_of_Malice allows you to solo her easily. Use wiki=Smoke_Screen to reduce pressure if you get low health.

name=Spell Blossoms
image=Pcq4xXe.jpg
tactic=normal
After enemy=Undergrowth_Spider_Queen:champion, there are 4 enemy=Volatile_Blossoms, a enemy=Archer and a enemy=Sylvari_Prisoner.
After them, there is a random enemy=text:Nightmare_Court|knight|duelist|sorcerer|archer, 6 enemy=Spell_Blossoms and lots of enemy=Volatile_Blossoms.
If the random enemy is a enemy=Knight:elite, pull him back to kill him safely. Otherwise just go in and destroy everything. Once Spell Blossoms are destroyed, Volatile Blossoms stop respawning.
At the tunnel, there is a enemy=Hound and 4 enemy=Pups. Focus on Hound as Pups will die very quickly. After them you will face enemy=Sariel in a room with 3 enemy=Sylvari_Prisoners.

name=enemy=Sariel:champion
image=USpAXrn.jpg
tactic=ranged
Keep her crippled and kite. Dodge when she dashes towards you. When she gets close, just jump down from ledges to create some distance.
tactic=melee
She hits pretty hard so try to avoid damage by staying behind her back. Stay at max-melee range to give you more time dodge when she dashes towards you.
tactic=exploit
She can be safespotted by standing on media=tas_sariel_exploit.jpg|a_ledge. Her dash will still hit you but can be easily healed.

name=Lake of Fear (after water tunnel)
image=UvF8k9l.jpg
tactic=normal
After enemy=Sariel there is a tunnel of water with 7 enemy=Barracudas. They are harmless and can be killed for experience. After tunnel, there is a huge area with lots of enemies. Don't aimlessly wander around or you will get yourself killed.
There are 4 enemy=Archers_(Stable) and 2 enemy=Sylvari_Prisoners near the entrance. On the right there are 2 enemy=Hounds and 6 enemy=pups. On the left there are 2 enemy=Cultists:elite, 1 enemy=Sorcerer and few enemy=Volatile_Blossoms.
In the middle there is an inactive enemy=Spell_Blossom and 4 enemy=Volatile_Blossoms. On the far left there are 4 enemy=Hounds, 4 ianctive enemy=Spell_Blossoms and lots of enemy=Volatile_Blossoms. At the end there is a enemy=Sorcerer, an enemy=Archer and 2 enemy=Sylvari_Prisoners.
Kill the archers at the entrance so you can observe the area without any disturbance. Move straight forward through the water towards the archer and the sorcerer and kill them. After that Caithe needs 3 items to build a bridge. At this point Spell Blossoms also activate.
Look at the map and go together while avoiding unnecessary enemies. The spring water is guarded by Hounds and Pups. The bundle of seeds is guarded by an enemy=Archer_(Stable). The third item can be acquired by killing enemy=Mutated_Fish. He is located in a water with about enemy=Barracudas.
Once you get the items, head back to Caithe and wait for him to build the bridge so you can take cre of enemy=Brangoire.
tactic=skip|coordinated
Run through everything. Split up to complete the tasks faster. You will generally want 3-4 players to take on the Mutated Fish, while the others deal with the Hounds and Archer.
tactic=thief
Stack stealth before the water tunnel so people won't get combat with enemy=Barracudas. Use a wiki=Smoke_Screen with 6 wiki=Cluster_Bomb|Cluster_Bombs. After tunnel stack bit more stealth with wiki=Black_Powder and wiki=Cluster_Bomb if needed.
When gathering ingredients you can get the spring water very fast with wiki=Shadowstep, wiki=Signet_of_Shadows, wiki=Infiltrator's_Arrow and wiki=Hide_in_Shadows. Don't use Shadowstep too early so it won't run out before you ge the water.

name=enemy=Mutated_Fish
tactic=ranged
He has only melee attacks so just keep kiting.
tactic=melee
He attacks frequently but won't deal much damage. With some sustain you should be able to tank him.
tactic=thief
Try to aggro him first to hopefully make him attack you. wiki=Nine-Tailed_Strike allows you block most of his attacks while dealing lots of damage. Use one wiki=Stab between every Strike.
Manage your initiative with wiki=Steal and wiki=Infiltrator's_Signet.

name=enemy=Brangoire:champion
image=DgnscLA.jpg
tactic=ranged|melee
He summons lots of enemy=Living_Nightmares:normal which explode as a poison gas.
tactic=ranged
| Stay mobile so you don't caught in it.
tactic=melee
| Circle him at max-melee range so you will avoid most damage. Bring lots of damage to kill Nightmare before they get close.
Dodge when he jumps in the air to evade his Terrifying Blast. Getting feared may cause lots of damage if you move towards Nightmare. Get a stun break just in case.
Reviving is extremely hard so don't get downed.

name=enemy=Cadeyrn:champion
image=G4eGEoK.jpg
image=kQYKvIa.jpg
tactic=normal
He reflects projectiles so pay attention. Occasionally he morphs someone into a cat. Kill a enemy=Pup:normal to break the transform.

name=Nursery
image=OlxkAFl.jpg
tactic=normal
You need to throw 4 Volatile Essences at the enemy=Husk:champion to make it vulnerable. To get essences, you have to open pods, kill the enemy=Volatile_Nightmare:elite inside of them and throw their essence.
Open pods one by one to avoid getting overrun. Nightmares can stack serious area Bleeding which can easily kill you, and as such it is a good idea to bring condition removal.
The husk is a melee attacker with plenty of launches. Try avoid all of it's attacks and get a stun break if you get in trouble. Group stability such as wiki=Hallowed_Ground is extremely useful.

name=enemy=Faolain:champion and the clones
image=M9kDctu.jpg
tactic=normal
You have to kill 4 clones. enemy=Eir:elite, enemy=zojja:elite, enemy=Rytlock:elite and enemy=Logan:elite. Once one is dead Faolain teleports in and attempts to resurrect them. You must either damage her enough (safer) or kill another clone (if any is low) in order to break her resurrection attempt.
Once resurrection fails that clone won't be resurrected even if you wipe so focusing is extremely important.
enemy=Eir:elite is most deadly so focus her first. enemy=zojja:elite should be second as she is also a ranged attacker.
enemy=Rytlock:elite And enemy=Logan:elite can easily be kited as they are melee attackers. If someone has their focus they can just run around the area.

To make the enemy=Greater_Vine:champion appear you need to kill 5 enemy=Nightmare_Vines:elite. After you kill the first Vine, 2 more will appear on the right side. Killing any of them will make another spawn, this time on the left side. Similarly, killing another Vine will cause the 5th one to spawn. Finally, after killing the 5th one, the boss will spawn.
################################################################

Whenever the champion loses 25% of its health more Nightmare Vines appear. If you have low dps party, focus the newly spawned Vine before going for the boss. At 25% you should just focus the champion because other Vines disappear once it is dead. Otherwise you can try to kill the boss before being overrun by additional Vines. Pay attention to enemy=Volatile_Blossoms:structure. Avoid them and destroy for easy rallying. Bring condition removal to remove poison.
################################################################

All the enemies can be easily skipped by sticking to the right side after you leave the underwater tunnel. enemy=Nightmare_Warder_(Sword):champion can either be skipped by running to the end of the next room or just killed since this champion does not present much of a challenge.
When killing people usually cross the bridge and stack media=taf_bubble_stack.jpg|on right but some teams go under the bridge and then media=taf_bubble_stack_alt.jpg|turn_right.
Some groups will pull the enemy=Nightmare_Warder_(Sword):champion to the enemy=Greater_Vine:champion that spawns to get additional champion bags. Do not pull the enemy=Nightmare_Warder_(Knight):champion as it has an incredible amount of low-cooldown CC, and will almost certainly wipe your group.

If you keep following the road you will face 9 random Nightmare Court enemy=text:enemies|Archer:elite|Cultist:elite|Duelist:elite|Knight:elite|Sorcerer:elite and multiple Vines. On the middle island there is a hiding enemy=Greater_Nightmare_Vine:champion. Finally, at the end of the road there is a enemy=Nightmare_Warder_(Sword):champion.

To proceed further you need to dispose of 4 enemy=Nightmare_Court_Archer_(Fire):elite protected. They are protected by fire shields which absorb projectiles and kill anyone trying to get through. If you want to use ranged weapons, use only those that do not involve any projectiles. Melee players should use blocks, blinds or invulnerability (evading does not work) to enter shields or pay attention to the mini-map and use portals at sides of the area to enter the appropriate bubbles.

Depending on your team composition, it might be possible to burst down adds by LoS-ing them on the left wall.

Otherwise, enemies could be pulled one by one. Try to start with the Knight since he presents the most threat. It might be tricky to pull just him, you need to stay at the right spot. Too close and every mob will come, too far and the pulled mob just goes back. If you stay too far back and he resets try to snare him while he does so, after few seconds he should become vulnerable.

Start by killing the lone enemy=Undergrowth_Recluse:elite. Shortly after, there are 2 enemy=Undergrowth_Webbers:elite. They usually start their rotation by using their long lasting immobilze (10 seconds), which they only use if there is at least one distant target, dodge or use projectile defense and deal with them normally.
Immediately after, you will enter an area with 4 groups of spiders and friendly (for now) enemy=Malrona:legendary. You should pull 1 or 2 groups at the same time to avoid being overrun. Start with the rightmost and the leftmost groups. Both of these groups are comprised of fairly easy enemies and include 8 enemy=Spider_Hatchlings:normal as well as 2 Webbers and Recluse with Webber. Two remaining groups are a bit harder, the right one includes enemy=Undergrowth_Stonetouch:elite which is able to petrify (unbreakable stun) your whole party for 5 seconds which might lead to a wipe. This group have also 8 Hatchlings like two previous ones and an additional Recluse. The last group is made of only elites, those are 2 Recluses, 2 Webbers and one enemy=Bloodfang:elite, deal with them similarly as with the previous ones.
################################################################
tactic=skip
In order to skip most of the enemies groups you need to use long lasting stealth. Avoid first enemy=Undergrowth_Recluse:elite and then 2 enemy=Undergrowth_Webbers:elite. You will enter an area with 4 groups and friendly (for now) enemy=Malrona:legendary.
You can avoid aggroing the rightmost and the leftmost groups but you have to defeat the two centre ones. Optimal option is to stack near the wall behind the furthest group. The first group is comprised of 8 enemy=Spider_Hatchlings:normal, enemy=Undergrowth_Recluse:elite and enemy=Undergrowth_Stonetouch:elite. Pay great attention to the Stonetouch, as it is able to petrify (unbreakable stun) your whole party for 5 seconds. The second group is made out of 5 elite spiders (2 enemy=Undergrowth_Recluses:elite, 2 enemy=Undergrowth_Webbers:elite and enemy=Undergrowth_Bloodfang:elite). Immediately after killing both groups of enemies, Malrona turns hostile.

name=enemy=Malrona:legendary
image=K1p1qJF.jpg
tactic=normal|coordinated
Malrona has only two attacks, Venom Spray and Blast, and she alternates between them. This makes her very predictable to fight. Both of her attacks have similar but not identical animations, so try to remember which one she used previously.
Venom Spray, is a frontal cone attack that hits 4 times and inflicts poison with every hit. Moreover, if anyone gets hit by it, Malrona will gain Predator swiftness buff that makes her moving fast. At the same time, any party member that is poisoned will deal much more damage. You should use this fact to your advantage and get hit by this attack on purpose. If you do so, keep in mind that you cannot remove poison, do not use any whirl or projectile finishers in conjunction with a light field as they are able to remove conditions either from your allies or from yourself.
The second of her attacks, Venom Blast, is much more dangerous. She launches multiple unblockable projectiles, concentrated on the targetted person, that on the contact with the ground explode, dealing a large amount of AoE damage.
################################################################
tactic=normal
| Avoiding this attack is easy if you stay away from her but is much harder in melee range where you have to dodge or block much earlier. If you are sure you're not her current target, stay behind her, as there should be less concentration of falling projectiles.

First part of this skip consists of 2 small groups of 2 enemy=Undergrowth_Stonetouch:elite and then 2 enemy=Undergrowth_Bloodfangs:elite. The only difficulty that comes with skipping is to avoid Stonetouches' petrify and not getting downed because of triggering too many enemy=Volatile_Blossoms:structure. Fortunately, you can use Blossoms for your advantage. Send a person with decent capabilities for destroying them, such as a guardian or preferably use stealth. Shortly after, 3 enemy=Nightmare_Vines:elite spawns, just turn left while avoiding their AoE fields and most importantly their stomps.
After Vines, you will enter a corridor filled with 2 groups of spiders. Try not to run close to them as they might cripple you. As always, avoid Stonetouches.

Shortly after defeating enemy=Malrona:legendary there are 2 enemy=Undergrowth_Stonetouch:elite with 2 enemy=Undergrowth_Bloodfangs:elite behind them.

After that, 3 enemy=Nightmare_Vines:elite spawns. You might simply skip them by turning left but if you want to kill the following groups it is safer if you don't have Vines blocking your escape route.
You will find yourself in a corridor filled with 2 groups of spiders. Try not to aggro both of them as you will be most likely overrun.

The fight starts after a short dialogue between Fyonna and Vevina and takes place in a room full of spider eggs. Anyone stepping on one of those eggs will spawn a random elite spider. Fyonna is primarily an archer with skills that either push or pull you which means that without stability you will probably be sent on one of those eggs. However, you can simply pull her outside the whole room to a corridor from where you came from and simply defeat her without worrying about additional spiders.
Every attack of her is considered as a projectile which means that with enough projectile defense you can trivialize most of the fight. Even if you don't, her attacks apply relatively low pressure, if someone dies just revive him and continue the fight. After some time, she transforms into a spider form that no longer use projectiles but is still relatively easy to dispatch.
When she dies, move through the room while avoiding spider eggs.

Similarly, the second group is relatively easy and most of the difficulty comes from the presence of enemy=Volatile_Blossoms:structure which can kill you rather fast if you don't destroy them before triggering them. As always, the easiest way is to use long lasting stealth.
################################################################

If your party lacks dps, try to stun that type of mobs since they can inflict a lot of damage even when you negate their first attack. Sorcerers, on the other hand, apply 6 seconds long AoE fear. Having a stunbreaker in that situation can be a life-safer. The priority in which you should focus enemies should be Knight, Sorcerer, Duelist, Archer and lastly Cultist.
After disposing that group, you will have to cross a narrow passage filled with 5 immobile Archers. You should skip them in almost all of the cases as they present relatively low threat.

After the cinematic ends do not come close to Leurent until he is dead, otherwise you will die. The enemy=Nightmare_Tree:legendary is considered an epic boss which means you cannot critically hit it but conditions work as if that would be normal enemy. That means you can easily keep it blinded completely negating its attacks. The Tree always starts by slamming the ground, prepare to evade it or try to blind it.
This boss has 4 attacks, the first one, mentioned just before, hits a target and everyone around him. Received damage is high enough to kill glass cannons. The second attack targets everyone and after a slight delay root spikes come from the ground. You can either dodge when the boss touches the ground or when red circles already appeared. Like in the case of the previous attack, you can simply blind the boss to nullify this attack. The two remaining attacks summon either Sylvari Mortar Turret or Healing Seed. The former attacks rather slowish but hits for considerable amount of damage. Fortunately, those are projectiles and you can block them with an anti projectile skill. Healing Seed periodically applies regeneration to the Nightmare Tree but the heals are rather negligible.

Stay in middle of the area so you don't have to worry about Blossoms. If you get downed attack a nearby Blossom to rally easily. Wait for the patrolling Hounds to come so you can fight them without aggroing the Husks. After the Hounds are dead continue with the Husks; lure them a bit towards dungeon entrance, so you don't have to deal with the spiders before you are ready. Make sure you have stability or a stun break to counter control from Hounds and Husks.
You can even split the Spiders if you desire. Simply hit the closest spider with a long range ability and move a bit back. If done correctly the second Spider spawn should not aggro with the first. Keep an eye on Stonetouch to move away or behind him when he glows to avoid a long unbreakable stun.

name=Ooze Escort
tactic=normal|alternative
Your goal is to lure 2 Oozes to the other side of the room to open the door.
There are 2 Flowers where you receive a 'Pheromone' Buff which lasts 45 seconds. Ooze will follow the person with that buff.
The room is filled with lava and leaves 2 paths open to get to the other side. Ooze is immune to cc but is affected by conditions and damage (fear works on it as edge case between condition and cc).
3 Lava Elementals will spawn for each Ooze and attack it. Their spit will immobilize the Ooze briefly and damage it. If you kill the Lava Elementals, they will respawn shortly after. 3 Elementals will be up per Ooze at almost all times.
The Ooze will take a lot of damage if it walks through the lava, so be careful to keep it on the defined paths.
The gate opens when both Oozes reach the other side alive within 10 seconds of each other.
tactic=normal
2 players grab the pheromone buff and start luring the Ooze at the same time. 1 player with pheromone per path. The remaining 3 players help the 2 luring players on their respective paths to keep the Oozes alive.
Use cc to knock the lava elementals away from the Ooze / interrupt their spit attack / keep them from following. Projectile absorb and projectile reflect are helpful to defend Ooze from spit.
Remember that killing the Lava Elementals only helps briefly because they respawn quickly after. Focus on cc or if you kill them, keep an eye out for respawning ones.
tactic=alternative
2 players run ahead to grab aggro from all 6 Lava Elementals and try to not die to them and stay away from the paths.
As long as you don't kill any Lava Elemental, no new ones will respawn because the number is limited to 6 overall (3 per side). You can lower their health and finish them off when Oozes get close if needed.
With Lava Elementals out of the way it is easier to keep Ooze alive - just move quickly with pheromones through the path and don't lure them through lava.

There are a enemy=Steam_Watcher:veteran, a enemy=Thug:veteran, a enemy=Swashbuckler:veteran, a enemy=Thumper:veteran and a enemy=Taskmaster:veteran around the area. At first Scarlet hologram you get ambushed by 2 enemy=Grenadiers:elite and a enemy=Thug:elite. At second hologram you get ambushed by 2 enemy=Swashbucklers:elite and a enemy=Striker:elite. At third hologram you get ambushed by 2 enemy=Taskmasters:elite and a enemy=Thumper:elite. enemy=Wurm_Hatchlings:normal and enemy=Spider_Hatchlings:normal respawn around the area. Generally easy fights.
Use line of Sight via standing behind rocks or use pull skills to group them up. Have condition removal ready against confusion and bleeding. stability is useful versus Thugs and projectile reflection versus Grenadiers.
Make sure to burst/cc the Steam Watcher as soon as he notices you - he will summon additional Aetherblades if left alive.
tactic=optional
Before third hologram there is small pond with half naked enemy=Thumper:elite and enemy=Striker:elite. They are completely pointless to kill unless you enjoy hitting naked people.

name=enemy=Slick:legendary and enemy=Sparki:legendary
tactic=normal
Blossoms won't do anything so you don't have to care about those. Before entering the room you should decide which one to focus. Both options have their own advantages so you should change your plan if you have trouble. It's also possible to kill them both at the same time but they will get stronger every 25% which will be too much for most groups.
Most groups kill Sparki first because she has 50% less health and deals lots of direct damage. However Slick takes ~21% more damage than Sparki and can deal much more damage if your party doesn't know how to handle his oil puddles. If you have trouble with the oil, consider killing Slick first. Once he is dead you can easily get out of combat which makes finishing Sparki extremely easy.
The key mechanic is to keep enemy=Oil-Absorbing_Ooze:normal alive and pull him to oil puddles which Slick creates. Watch your area damage, accidentally killing the ooze creates 10 oil puddles which will kill your party in few seconds. Ooze follows a player with the Pheromone buff. If multiple players have the buff, he will follow the closest. Buff can be gained either occasionally from Slick or from a nearby plant. The plant should only be used if absolutely needed because it just wastes time and makes Ooze pulling more confusing when multiple players have the buff.
The most importang thing is to stay close to each other. Oil puddles are shot at players so if everyone spreads you won't be able to clean them on time. You have to also stay mobile because you will take damage equal to 75% of your maximum health if the ooze manages to hit you. His attack can be easily avoided by just moving away but dodge if needed.
If you have the buff and Ooze is following you then your job is to pull it to the oil puddles. Run through the puddles if needed, just dodge if they are on fire. If you fail to do your job correctly then the puddles will slowly kill your whole party. Don't attempt to revive downed players unless you can get them up before ooze kills them.
At start Slick has 3 ranged attacks. If he kneels, shouts and glows he is going to shoot a puddle. Otherwise he will either shoot a green ball which applies Pheromone or a blue dart which applies weakness and bleeding. After 75% he will use puddle attack two times in a row. After 50% he starts jumping which causes fear on a target. After 25% Sparki (not Slick!) enrages which causes her to attack more often and deal more damage. Also everyone gets "Hot Foot" debuff which causes burning if you not moving.
Unlike Slick, Sparki can do some direct damage. Pay attention to her and try to learn her animations. Her basic ranged attack deals good damage and lits puddles so try to dodge it. But more importantly be ready to dodge when she raises his arms (hard to see because of her size). She will pull you in and then leap with a knockback and burning resulting in lots of damage. Leap happens also on melee range so pay attention.
After 75% she occasionally starts spinning and shoot unblockable projectiles all around the area. You should get some distance to reduce amount of projectiles hitting you. Alternatively go stand behind someone else so you don't take any damage. After 50% she will also jump like Slick but with fear and burning (really hard to see because of her size). After 25% Slick (not Sparki!) enrages which causes him to attack more often and deal more damage.
The main reason why the puddles are so dangerous is that they deal unavoidable damage on a huge area every second. If you let the puddles to stack there's literally nothing you can do. His other attacks aren't big deal but you should have a stun break against the fear. You should also have condition removal to remove weakness and long burning (if you get from Sparki).
If you killed Sparki first it's really important to stick together. He can easily put 10 puddles which results in 2000 damage per second. Focus on cleaning the oil and avoiding the ooze.
If you killed Slick first then just clean up remaining puddles and start playing safe. Run away to get out of combat if needed.

tactic=normal
Some Aetherblade Veterans patrolling the floors. Generally easy fights.
You can abuse line of Sight them at a pillar to kill them faster. Have condition removal ready against confusion and bleeds. stability is useful against Thugs and projectile reflection against Grenadiers.
You will encounter enemy=Holographic_Generators:structure for the first time. They take negligible damage from your attacks, so pull the holograms they spawn and kill them close to the reactor to inflict severe damage.
They also inflict 1 stack of confusion on players and low-medium damage. Be careful if you kill many of them at once in close proximity. Evade explosion or kill them at range if you want to be safe. If you go down, target a hologram and attack it, you can rally off them.
After destroying 3 generators, you reach the room where enemy=Foreman_Spur:legendary and his troops are stationed. You don't have to fight them all at once. Instead move either to the right and LOS pull a few Aetherblades to kill them or walk to the other side of the room and LOS behind the pillar there.

#Keep some distance so you won't hit by his melee attacks. Pay attention when he throws axes in air to move away from red circles. If you stay there you will die in seconds.

tactic=normal
Clear the enemies before you aggro him. Pull about 33% of enemies behind a nearby corner. Then move to the other side of them room and pull 50% of remaining enemies behind a piller. Then finish of last enemies. There is a enemy=Steam_Watcher patrolling on the area. Take him down when he is alone.
His most notable move is the Axe Spin. He roars, removes cripple, chill and immobilize on him and moves quickly spinning towards his target. He prefers targeting most distant players which you should use at your advantage. If you have a immunity ready you can move away from him and vice versa.
Be careful to not use projectiles during his Axe spin, as he is not only evading, but reflecting it back to you or your allies. If he has less than 25% defiance, you can interrupt his Axe spin with most instantly casted cc (second part of guardian's binding blade for example). If you cant interrupt it, move away from him/dodge/use invulnerability skills as it deals a lot of AoE damage while inflicting bleeding, crippled and vulnerability on you.
When he throws axes, they leave high damaging areas which you should avoid. The axe throw can be reflected. He hits quite hard and fast on close range so stay behind him.
After 75% his Axe Spin creates a windy area at end of the channel. You cannot leave this area (even with stability) and it will destroy all projectiles. If you are outside get in so you can deal damage.  The area will disappear before he uses Axe Spin giving you time to move away.

Achievement 'Who's in Charge Here?' is bit complicated. Patrols don't count as his crew. You can attack his crew before aggroing Spur but you can't kill a whole row (nearest enemies to Spur form one row and so on). This means you can just go to the right side, pull enemies front of Spur and kill them without losing the achievement.
Once necessary enemies have been cleared just pull Spur alone and finish him off. The fight may be little harder because of limited space. You will still get the achievement even if you wipe so keep trying (unknown if you can lose it somehow). Once Spur is dead kill rest of the crew.

name=Electricity Puzzle
tactic=normal
The room consists of 8*8 squares on the ground. 4 of these squares contain pillars that are connected to the generator. The ground will be mostly electrified and moves in a pattern of 1 square per second into a specific direction.
Your goal is to reach the pillar that has a circle hovering over it without touching the electrified ground. If you receive negative charge from the ground, the pillar will knock you back.
Try to read in which direction the pattern is moving on move in sync with it on the free spots to reach the pillar. Getting charged from the electricity cannot be blocked, but you can dodge through it or use invulnerability skills as well as using blinks to cover distance to make it easier.
Only 1 player has to reach a pillar to activate it. Once active a beam of light will shoot up from it and after ~5 seconds the whole ground will be electrified without free spots, so make sure get back to the entrance or on a pillar to prevent getting damaged. After each activation the direction of pattern changes.
1 player needs to stay on each of the 4 pillars to charge the generator. A enemy=Holographic_Thug:normal will spawn once fully charged. It will despawn immediately if a pillar is left unattended.
The 5th player can attack the Thug briefly to grab aggro and lure it to the closed door. Kill it there and the explosion will open your way. If you kill it in the wrong spot, a new Thug will spawn after ~3 seconds.
tactic=warrior
If you have problems with aggro you can try to use wiki="Fear_Me!" to move Thug to the proper direction (doesn't always work). Stand as close to to the closed door as you can to get Thug on the proper position.
tactic=optional
If you want to get the achievement easily you should inform your team about it (some groups may expect you to do your part of the puzzle). All you have to do is let someone reach the first platform, wait for all electricity to go off, run to the platform and then just wait there until everything is clear.
tactic=exploit
The electrified floor damages you periodically. If you jump at the right time you can stand on it without getting damage or the debuff.

name=Freeing the Clockheart
tactic=normal
This room is filled with 8 enemy=Holographic_Generators:structure. You are required to destroy all 8 via killing holograms in proximity to the generators. If you wipe before all 8 are destroyed, previously destroyed generators will respawn.
Use a similar tactic to the Holographic Generators you encountered earlier. Pull holograms close to the generators either with pulling skills or breaking line of sight behind a generator. Then just kill them close to the generator.
Be careful if you kill many holograms at once as multiple explosions may down you. Evade the explosion or back a bit off when they are about to die. If you go down, target a hologram and attack it to rally off them. Run away to get out of combat if needed.
The ground will get electrified at times. Watch for pillars in the room. When they rise up, the ground will get electrified around ~2 seconds later, so jump on it to be safe from the electricity.

name=enemy=Clockheart:legendary
tactic=ranged|melee
Start moving immediately once the cutscene ends because Clockheart will initiate with Gear Throw. He throws a ballistic projectile at every distant target. Upon reaching ground it will create a spinning gear which kills fast if you stand on it. If you need to run through one remember to dodge. Blocking or reflecting prevents Gear from appearing.
Keep this in mind when reviving people. If you are away from him he will most likely throw one at you. If this happen the downed guy will get defeated if you fail to get him up before the gear lands or block/reflect the gear.
tactic=ranged
Pay attention to your positioning. Either stay at close enough range so he won't throw gears at you or stay near walls so gears get thrown at remote locations. Also try to make gears appear close together to reduce risk of anyone accidentally walking into them.
tactic=melee
His normal melee hits do low damage but apply weakness and vulnerability. Try to stay behind him if you aren't his primary target. He also occasionally throws you behind his back. It's hard to avoid so ensure that there is nothing dangerous behind him like electrified middle area or a gear. If there is then move around him. Alternatively you can also use a stun break. If you are kiting him pay attention to the surrounding area so you won't walk into a gear.
tactic=ranged|melee
He has two key animations. When he raises one arm he will apply torment and do powerful frontal cone. Either move behind him or dodge when arm hits the ground. When he raises two arms he will Immobilize and start supercharge when he hits the ground. Either run out of the area or dodge it.
During his supercharge he is immune to conditions and takes no damage. If he reaches 30 stacks he will again raise two arms and do multiple powerful room wide PBAoEs downing weaker targets (damage increases a lot when he is below 25%). Either interrupt it (he loses stacks so can't use again) or use an immunity / stability with dodges to prevent most of the damage. First PBAoE hits bit before the arms smash the ground so try to act early enough! Also one quarter of the room gets electrified.
To interrupt his charging (and remove any accumulated electricity from the room) you need to kill a enemy=Holographic_Aetherblade_Striker:normal near him. He will be in one of the corners and respawn shortly after killed (if he is far you can kill him to make him appear closer). If everyone works together you can easily interrupt charging every time. Remember to use pulling skills or break line of sight if needed. Striker has really low health so be careful to not kill him.
tactic=warrior
If you expect Clockheart to reach 30 stacks take wiki=Endure_Pain, wiki=Riposte or wiki=Shield_Stance to counter it.
tactic=warrior
wiki=Balanced_Stance or wiki=Dolyak_Signet gives you the needed stun break and stability if you have to dodge Clockheart's super attack.
tactic=warrior
When reviving people be ready with a blocking skill (wiki=Riposte, wiki=Shield_Stance or wiki=Counter_Blow to destroy any thrown Gears.
tactic=rewards
There is a very low chance to get wiki=Aetherized_Nightmare_weapons from the final chest after enemy=Clockheart. These can be traded and are extremely valuable.

name=After match
tactic=normal
This part is not needed and is only done for achievements. If you want to do all task you have to split up. Half of the team immediately goes down to defend Lionguard while others kill officers. Once officers are dead they get back and enter secret room with Caithe. In the room they interact with suggestion box and kill the Horror. Then just use EMP found on Clockheart's room to disable ships and hunt the chests.
