name=enemy=Prototype_Golem:champion
tactic=normal
Try to break his defiance for a damage boost but don't rely on it too much because control works inconsistently. He has 3 main attacks; Laser, Pull and Fire Spin. Sometimes he also uses Dual Rockets for a massive damage.
Laser is used when he moves his arms behind his back. He will shoot a beam at one target for about 3 seconds. It only causes vulnerability so don't panic when you get targeted. Be ready to dodge when it ends because he will shoot a rocket which deals high area damage. Alternatively you can seek cover behind obstacles but keep the blast radius in mind.
Pull is used when he points his right arm at you. He will shoot a fast projectile at one target which pulls the target towards him. This is not dangerous because he doesn't have any follow up attacks. However you will lose damage output by getting briefly disabled so try to dodge it. He has a poor aim so instead of dodging you can easily avoid the attack by zig-zagging. This works even at close range.
Fire Spin is used when he spreads his arms. He will spin in place and shoot flames around him in short range. The attack deals moderate damage so watch out if you aren't tanky. Try to break the defiance to stop the attack.
Dual Rockets are used when he moves his right arm behind his back. The animation can be hard to see so focus on looking at rockets. Be ready to dodge if you suddenly see two rockets in the air. He doesn't use this attack often so try to kill him quickly.
tactic=melee
Try to stay behind his back at all times. Be ready to dodge when he turns towards you because he will probably attack you next.
Run a bit away from him if you have low health and he is using Laser on you. This gives you more time to dodge the rocket.
tactic=ranged
Stay at range so you don't have care about Fire Spin. Move away from him if you get pulled in.
Try to spread a bit so it's easier see when he is attacking you and to avoid area damage from rockets.
tactic=coordinated
Stack might and fury while waiting for him to appear. Break the defiance immediately (some control skills don't work?) to burst him down.
It doesn't matter much if you fail to burst him because he isn't very dangerous.

name=Way to enemy=Door_Guard:champion
Get inside the house and follow the shining path. Door Guard turns aggressive about 7 seconds after enemy=Logan reaches him so be ready.

name=enemy=Door_Guard:champion
tactic=normal
Door Guard has 2 high damage melee attacks; Slash and Spin. Both attacks have a surprisingly high range so watch out.
Slash is his basic melee attack which deals moderage damage. It also sometimes deals bleeding.
Spin is used when he glows. He will stand still and hit multiple times over several seconds for a high damage. He will rotate towards his main target during the attack. If he is facing you then dodge directly away from him and wait until the attack ends. Don't move around so you don't turn him towards other players. If he is not facing you then just dodge behind his back and keep attacking him.
tactic=melee
You can't melee him safely because his attacks have a 260 range. Try to stay behind his back to avoid most hits. If you being targeted then stay still and only dodge directly away from him.
tactic=ranged
Keep some distance at all times so he can't hit you. Jump over some furniture if you get in bad spot.
tactic=coordinated
Stack might and fury while waiting for him to turn aggressive. Break the defiance immediately to burst him down.
tactic=exploit
You can stand on the statue to his left (next to the curved stairs case) and use range attacks from safety, without making him reset.
If you fail to burst him down then be ready to dodge when he uses Spin.

name=Ambush
tactic=normal
Don't rush in to the next room after enemy=Door_Guard:champion because you will get ambushed by lots of enemies. They are much easier to kill if you ambush them instead. The idea is to enter the room, trigger the ambush and then run back so the enemies have to come to you.
The best way to do this is to stack near the doorway or behind the door?. One player should enter and immediately fall back when hearing dialogue. Melee and area attacks can hit enemies through walls so position yourself properly and keep attacking the air until all enemies are dead. Use blind and projectile defenses to reduce damage taken.
If you don't wish to stack you can also just enter the room together because the enemies aren't that dangerous.
tactic=coordinated
Quickly stack might and fury if needed. Enter the room together and focus elite enemies with area attacks to also kill normal enemies. Use blind and reflects to reduce damage taken and kill enemy=Snipers.
tactic=bug
The 3 elites can be pulled out of the room with a long range attack without triggering the ambush. However they will respawn when the ambush is triggered.
tactic=exploit
The 3 elites can be pulled out of the room with a long range attack without triggering the ambush. To prevent them from respawning, the ambush must be triggered before they die so try to damage them evenly. Trigger the ambush when elite enemies have about 20% health left.

name=Cellar
tactic=normal
The first room has a enemy=bomber:elite, 2 enemy=fighters:elite and a enemy=Sniper:elite. Hug the right side of the opening leading to them and attack them as they turn the corner. Use projectile defenses to block the sniper and bomber. Try to keep blinds on the fighters.
The second hoom has a enemy=Separatist_Fighter:Champion and 2 enemy=Fighters:elite. They will turn hostile about 6 seconds after the dialogue starts. All 3 enemies can kick for a knockback which has a higher range than their normal attack. They may also cripple with their daggers. Stay at range to avoid most damage.
tactic=skip
Go down the stairs, turn left and hug the furthest walls from the elites as you move towards enemy=Fighter:Champion.
During the fight dodge towards the walls next to the champion. Otherwise the enemies from the previous room may aggro if you get too close.
tactic=coordinated
Stealth at the bottom of the stairs and move straight toward the elites until they begin pathing. Wait until they stop moving and then run to the champion. Alternatively you can just run to the champion and kill following enemies during the dialogue.
Stack might and fury during the dialogue. Break her defiance and burst her down.
tactic=bug
After killing all enemies the event may be stuck at 2/3 separatists killed and you can't push the secret button.
The champion may be in some other area. Search the initial area where you killed enemy=Prototype_Golem and the basement.

name=enemy=Separatist_Lieutenant_(Sword):champion
tactic=normal
Lieutenant will turn hostile when you get within ~1000 range. He has 4 attacks; Slash, Ambush, Cyclone Axe and Envenom.
Slash is his basic melee attack chain which deals low damage so you don't have to care about it.
Ambush is used when he glows and leans back. After few seconds he will leap at his target dealing moderate damage. If the leap hits he will do a follow-up attack with multiple hits in a row for a high damage. It's important to evade or block the leap to avoid the follow-up attack.
Cyclone Axe is used when he holds his glowing right arm behind his back. After few seconds he will spin in place which deals moderate damage to every target around him. You can just move away from him or dodge through him after a second.
Envenom is used when he raises his arms with a green ball between them. This causes his attacks to deal poison which slightly increases his damage output.
tactic=melee
He is easy to melee because his stronger attacks have clear animations. Be ready to dodge when you see him glowing. You can move a bit away from him to give more time to react.
tactic=ranged
He has only melee attacks so just keep some distance. Be ready dodge when he is using Ambush.
tactic=coordinated
Get closer until he turns hostile and then stack might and fury if needed. Break the defiance to burst him down.

name=Reviving Sigfast
tactic=normal
The first room has a enemy=Separatist_Lieutenant_(Rifle):champion, a enemy=Sniper:elite and a enemy=Fighter:elite. Lieutenant shoots fast projectiles so use projectile defense if you have any. Use area attacks to take down elite enemies while focusing the lieutenant. Use blind against elite enemies to reduce pressure.
The second room has a enemy=Separatist_Fighter:champion, 3 enemy=Fighters:elite and a sleeping enemy=Sigfast. Use blind to reduce pressure.
Once enemies are dead, 3 enemy=fighters:elite and a enemy=Separasit_Lieutenant_(Rifle) spawns in the left tunnel. Break the line of sight to pull them together for more effective area damage and control.
tactic=coordinated
Stack might and fury if needed. Don't bother pulling enemies. Just break the defiance and burst enemies down.
tactic=bug
If you approach the gate to the next area the enemy=Fighter:champion and 2 enemy=Fighters:elite beyond the gate will teleport to you.

name=Outside area
tactic=normal
There are lots of enemies so don't rush in. After the gate there are a enemy=Figther:champion and 2 enemy=Fighters:elite. Try to pull them inside to avoid aggroing patrolling enemies.
Two groups of enemy=Huntings_Dogs:elite are patrolling the road. About halfway of the road there are treehouses with 3 enemy=Snipers:elite and lots of other enemies.
It's safer to wait for patrols to get closer because snipers have a surprisingly high range. If you go too far they will start shooting at making the fight much harder unless you have projectile defenses.
Hunting dogs inflict a long lasting fear with their Howl. Take lots of stability, stun breaks or instant condition cleanse to prevent getting disabled for a very long time.
Once patrols are killed take a look at where snipers are located. Snipers can't move so you can use terrain against them. Rush towards the first tree and stay behind it or stairs while you kill the other enemies.
Keep in mind that this part can be really chaotic. If you are struggling call targets and try get at least one enemy down befoure you get defeated. With a good team just focus the champion.
tactic=skip
Skipping all enemies is very difficulty, especially without stealth. Kill the enemies after the gate to give you more space.
If you have stealth you can use it to avoid patrols. If not, wait until they move away. Hug left wall until you get to the trees. Run below the first sniper and use area attacks to clear all enemies. Then finish remaining snipers.
Run along the rocks and go past the second group of dogs. Keep dodging while you go through them to avoid damage and fear?. Run until they stop following.
tactic=coordinated
Stealth immediately once enemy=Sigfast is saved because the first enemy group will rush in. Wait until they reach you so they stop pathing. Keep stealth up to skip patrols safely.
Focus snipers down one by one with area attacks to also clear other enemies. Use projectile defenses to reduce pressure.
Jump over the rocks or stealth to skip the second patrol.
tactic=exploit
The snipers can't move which allows you to place AoEs under them without being attacked.

name=enemy=Separatist_Captain_DeLana:champion
tactic=normal
DeLana and other enemies are initially friendly. When you reach enemy=Queen_Jennah they will turn hostile in about 7 seconds.
Use area attacks and projectile defenses.
tactic=coordinated
Stack might and fury during the dialogue. Break the defiance to burst enemy=Separatist_Captain_DeLana:champion down.
tactic=exploit
enemy=Separatist_Captain_DeLana:champion has only projectile attacks and enemy=Queen_Jennah has a permanent reflective shield. You can simply stand inside the shield to stay unharmed. You don't even have to participate in the battle because DeLana will eventually die to her own attacks.
Also DeLana can't move so you can easily abuse nearby terrain to heal up if needed.

name=Destroying parts
tactic=normal
Interact with parts to make enemy=Traffa destroy them. Go to media=cm1_parts.jpg|cellar (as in story) after clearing the first part. The cellar is split to a west wing, a center and a right wing. Whole cellar includes 9 parts and 27 enemies.
Enemies are often skipped because there are so many of them. Keep in mind that some parties expect Thieves to do this alone. Consider practising this alone few times if you want to join experience groups. However all professions can do it alone and it's much faster when done by two players.
The exact order of parts doesn't matter but you want to leave the west wing last because that has an exit from the cellar. After stairs there is a room immediately on the right side containing 3 enemy=Cutpurses:elite, 2 enemy=Riflemen:elite and a part (number 4 in the picture).
Riflemen shoot fast projectiles dealing high damage to moving targets so either pull enemies behind a corner or use projectile reflection. Riflemen also have a high range so they may shoot you from other rooms. Cutpurses have quick melee attacks and occasionally jump over you dealing 24 stacks of bleeding so take condition removal. Blind is useful to reduce pressure.
Go to south-east after destroying the part 4. The next room has a random mix of 3 enemy=Cutpurses:elite and enemy=Riflemen:elite. You can use a similar tactic as before or just kill them since there are only 3 enemies. A enemy=Cutpurse:elite may join the figth from the next room but it's nothing to worry about. Destroy the part number 3 and then the part number 1 from the next room.
Go to south-west to the east wing. The room at the end has a random mix of 4 enemy=Curpurses:elite and enemy=Riflemen:elite. Watch out for riflemen when you are getting close. Use the same tactic as before.
Once the part 2 is destroyed the progress should show 4/9. Go back hugging the left wall all way to the west wing. The west wing has a corridor with 2 rooms next to it and 1 room at the end. There are 2 enemy=Riflemen:elite and a enemy=Bomber:elite in the corridor who will attack when you move past the corner. Don't rush towards them or you will aggro enemies from all rooms and probably get defeated.
Instead dodge twice to the first room with 2 enemy=Flame_Turrets and 2 parts. Turrets can't rotate so you can freely destroy them from behind. After destroying the 2 parts you have two options. Either use ranged attacks and reflects to take down enemies at corridor from distance or rush to the next room. Taking down the enemies at the corridor is suggested because it's less chaotic and easier to handle. Rushing to the next room requires everyone following the tactic.
The second room has 2 enemy=Flame_Turrets, a enemy=Cutpurse:elite and 3 enemy=Archers:elite. Archers won't deal much damage but they are hard to kill because they often evade attacks and also apply blind. When killing them make sure you move behind turrets so they won't hit you.
The last room has enemy=Sure_Shot_Seamus:legendary, 2 enemy=Rifle_Turrets and 2 enemy=Net_Turrets. Seamus will turn friendly at 25% health so trying to kill him is pointless because you get no experience or loot. Check the optional tactic if you wish to kill him. Just destroy the 2 Net Turrets so no one gets stuck and then the last 2 parts. Remove immobilize from the party and then exit the cellar from the opened gate.
tactic=optional
enemy=Sure_Shot_Seamus:legendary is considered optional because he turns friendly at 25% health. He can be killed in the path 3.
Focus down the 2 enemy=Net_Turrets and 2 enemy=_Rifle_Turrets to reduce pressure. Avoid attacking Seamus because he turns much more dangerous at 95% health.
Seamus starts with pistols and has 2 attacks; Shoot and Chain Shot. Shoot is his basic ranged attack which deals moderate damage. Chain Shot is used when he glows. He will shoot lots of fast projectiles for a high damage. If you see him shooting at you then just dodge.
The fight actually starts when Seamus has lost 5% of his health and he switches to a shotgun. He has only one attack, Shrapnel Blast. It's a short-range cone which deals moderate damage, bleeds and knocks back. Keep in mind that he will attack again before the disable ends. This lets him hit you multiple times before you get knocked out of his range. Don't rely on anti projectile skills because the attack isn't a projectile.
The real problem is when you get stuck in a terrain and will never move out of his range. This means you will get permanently disabled unless someone else gets aggro or you have a stun break. However because of the small room this will happen very easily so you either need lots of stun breaks or have to know what you are doing.
With a decent party you can just break his defiance, burst him down and then use area stability for the remaining health. With a weaker party the simplest tactic is to have 1 player at melee and rest at range. The player who has the aggro must melee. This is quite easy to do because you can avoid all his attacks by just circling around him when you have the aggro. Everyone else should be ready to support if the melee player does a mistake.
If the player who has aggro is very good he can control the direction of Seamus's attacks. This allows everyone else safely melee him behind his back and kill him much faster.
tactic=skip
The enemies are often skipped because there is so many them and they also deal lots of damage. The easiest way is to run together which reduces pressure and ensures that at least someone gets through. Splitting up is not suggested unless you know what you are doing because you need enemy=Traffa with you to get a part destroyed.
Running together is usually quite chaotic when people may drag enemies with them so be prepared. Take lots of survivability including condition removal. If you are confident about your own skills just let other players be the cannon fodder.
The whole thing can be done easily alone with some practice. Experienced parties often ask thieves to do it. If you want to join experienced parties as a thief consider practising this a few times.
This media=cm1_parts.jpg|map has a layout of the cellar and suggested order of the parts. Turn left right after the stairs. Then hug the right wall so you don't aggro a nearby enemy=Cutpurse:elite. Enter the first room along the corridor and trigger the part through the wall.
Use stealth, evades, blocks and immunity to avoid shots from enemy=Riflemen:elite when getting the part 2 from the east wing. Once it's destroyed go back the same way. Remember hug the left wall so you avoid that Cutpurse.
Using the same tactic trigger both parts 3 and 4. Then run to the first room on the west wing to lose aggro. If you got hit by those 2 enemy=Flame_Turret at the doorway then destroy them to get out of combat. Don't bother entering the second room. Get the part at end of corridor while avoiding shots from Riflemen and nets from enemy=Net_Turrets. Be ready to remove immobilized if you get hit by a net.
After the part 7 immediately turn right so you don't aggro enemy=Sure_Shot_Seamus and trigger the part on the second room through the wall. You can run to the closed gate if you need to wait for cooldowns. Turrets can't hit you if you stand at the correct spot. Get the last part while avoiding the nets and then escape through the gate. If you are alone you can also use ranged attacks to destroy turrets when you are at the gate but it's much slower than just getting the part and then dying.
tactic=mesmer
youtube=UUPb-fGfZ1M|Video of a solo.
tactic=warrior
youtube=sUW3EWot7jw|Video of a solo.
tactic=thief
Thief is the best professions because you can stay permanently stealthed with wiki=Smoke_Screen, wiki=Blinding_Powder, wiki=Shadow_Refuge, wiki=Hide_in_Shadows, wiki=Black_Powder and wiki=Cluster_Bomb. Also switch to initiative, stealth and mobility related traits when practising. wiki=Withdraw and wiki=Signet_of_Shadows can be taken when you are experience for more speed.
tactic=coordinated
Split around the area. With 2 players, one player goes to the part 5 in the west wing without triggering it. Other player collects parts with order 4, 3, 1 and 2. When that's done the other player gets parts from the west wing. The first player can just die when he is done but running is also an option. The cleanest way is if he manages to stay out of combat in the east wing. Then he can waypoint out of the cellar to rest of the party. Keep in mind that some enemies may teleport with you.
With more players, the parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 are split to 2 players. Any additional players should go to the part 5 to make that part easier. Start with parts 1 and 2. The first player should open the waypoint dialog when the part 1 is done so he can teleport out much faster.

name=enemy=Gunpowder_Morgan:legendary
tactic=normal
A cutscene triggers when you approach Morgan at the barn. When it ends, 2 enemy=Riflemen:elite and 10 enemy=Riflemen:normal appear on the second floor and start shooting at you. Anti projectile skills are extremely valuable against them and Morgan. Focus on Riflemen first and take cover behind terrain if needed. Blind is very effective against Riflemen because they attack slowly.
Morgan has 3 attacks; Throw Bomb, Throw Bomb and Kick. The first Throw Bomb is his basic ranged attack which makes him shoot a ballistic projectile with a moderate area damage and vulnerability. With some sustain this can be easily tanked.
The second Throw Bomb is used when he spins. This happens instantly so it's very hard to dodge. The attack causes him to throw lots of his basic attacks around him. You can easily get hit multiple times downing you instantly. The best way to counter this is to have a projectile reflect up so he takes that massive damage instead.
Kick is used when he jumps. This happens very quickly so it's very hard to dodge. The attack causes moderate damage and a knockback.
tactic=exploit
If you skip the cinematic you can run up to get near Riflemen them before they appear. Someone must watch the cinematic so communicate with your party.

tactic=melee|ranged
After cutscene 2 enemy=Riflemen:elite and 10 enemy=Riflemen:normal appear on the second floor. If you skip the cinematic you can run up to get near them before they appear. Someone must watch the cinematic so communicate with your party.
Stick to left side to be covered against enemies. Get up and kill them. Then kill Morgan.
tactic=ranged
Keep some distance. If he attacks you then just move left or right to avoid his slow grenades. Dodge towards him when he spins to throw a barrage of grenades.
tactic=melee
At close range he is quite dangerous. On top of his normal attack he may kick you (hard to avoid) or spin and throw lots of grenades. Anti-projectile skills are very useful.
At close range you have to block/dodge them(the animation doesn't match the throw, you need to start a dodge before he throws at melee range).
tactic=exploit
You can stand under the landing of the staircase in the corner opposite the stairs to attack Morgan with range and no aggro(phantasms and pets will not be attacked).
You can also stand on the top level to the left of the corner and attack Morgan with a ranged weapon and no aggro(requires you to clear riflemen).
tactic=coordinated|exploit
One party member can blink inside the barn, blinking past the cutscene trigger point(second torch on the left wall). This player can then stand on Morgan and watch the cutscene.
tactic=coordinated
Run in (one player before the others to avoid issues with multiple cutscenes triggering) to watch the cutscene. Stack might, and then have them skip. Maintain projectile defense, and melee Morgan. It is ideal to skip the Chest (until the end of the dungeon, when you can come back for it), due to problems with getting in combat or dying to the riflemen.

name=Way to Victoria
tactic=normal|skip
First enemy group consists of a enemy=Saboteur:elite, a enemy=Thug:elite, an enemy=Archer:normal, an enemy=Enforcer_(Sniper):normal and a enemy=Cutpurse:normal. Second group consists of 3 enemy=Riflemen:elite, a enemy=Bomber:elite, a enemy=Net_Turret:structure, a enemy=Rifle_Turret:structure and a enemy=Flame_Turret:structure.
tactic=normal
Pull first group around the rock for AoE damage. Focus on Thug and try to keep him interrupted so he can't heal and buff others. Dodge explosion or run out of range when Saboteur throws a keg (big red circle). Use anti projectile skills against second group. Try to block/dodge Riflemen's shots when getting closer. Also avoid unnecessary movement to reduce damage. Focus Bomber if you go melee because of her AoE damage.
tactic=skip
First group will aggro when you get closer but they won't catch you if you move fast. If you are bit behind be ready to dodge Thug's Shield Bash. Keep evading and blocking when going through second group because Riflemen can kill you very easily when you are moving.
tactic=coordinated
Stealth. Path the first group, either in an SR (conservative), or in additional blasted stealth (difficult). The second group does not need to be pathed.

name=enemy=Bloody_Victoria:legendary
tactic=melee|ranged
She has only melee attacks so you can easily run away or even jump down from upper platform to avoid dying. While many groups will lure her to the upper platform, there is no combat advantage in doing so, and it typically only prolongs the encounter--it is superior to simply fight on top of where the boss spawns.
tactic=ranged
| Keep some distance so you don't unnecessarily take damage from her attacks. When she appears from stealth, dodge immediately then attack her.
tactic=melee
| She won't hit very hard but if you aren't durable you can try to stay at max melee range. She often alternates between her faster and slower attack. The latter can be avoided by just moving away from her.
tactic=melee|ranged
Occasionally she will stealth and either stun with Backstab or jump over her target with Death Blossom. To reduce her time in stealth don't run away if you can afford getting hit (pretty much all the time unless you are only one alive). You can still see her on mini map and attack her with untargeted attacks.
Stun will hit through block so the only way to avoid getting one shot is to have a stun break, stability or Aegis. Take as many as you may need unless you can rely on your team. Keep her defiance low to interrupt Backstab. If people get hit and go down, ressurecting them should be your first priority.
If she uses Death Blossom you should dodge immediately to prevent most of the damage. Remove bleeding if someone gets 6 stacks.
tactic=warrior
Take wiki="Shake_It_Off!" for a low cooldown stun break and condition removal. Consider taking wiki=Stomp for a backup and an interrupt.
Use wiki=Tremor as a high damage interrupt.
tactic=coordinated
Break her defiance and burst her down before she is able to do anything.

name=Big area with lots of enemies
tactic=fight
There are two big groups of Elite/Normal-Bandits. There are a small group of elite Bandits and 2 enemy=Riflemen:elite in the next room. Once you approach those Riflemen, 4 more Riflemen will spawn behind you.
Killing all the enemies will be very tough and take lots of time. Instead, you should sneak through.
One player should hug left wall to get past without aggro. Then he pulls a small enemy group back to rest of the party. Fighting between big groups and Riflemen is very risky.
Run to 2 Riflemen and go immediately right under the platform. This forces all 6 Riflemen to come into melee range.
tactic=skip
Just run through all the mobs.
You can also stick to right and run past the big enemy groups. Get up on the platform and jump down to break aggro.
Clear riflemen or wait for cooldowns to finish then continue.
tactic=coordinated
Stealth to the left under the scaffolding, run straight towards the 2 aggressive riflemen on the boards. Either quickly blast before them or use a non-field stealth to path the mobs following you.
Continue running past the next groups of mobs, reapply stealth at the boulder before the cave opens up to path the mobs or run past the last 3 and go into the back corner in the shallow water near the gate to break aggro.

name=enemy=Frost:legendary
tactic=ranged
Frost inflicts chilled and deals very high damage. Run around/kite to reduce the damage taken.
First focus all turrets to reduce pressure. Focus golems when they wake up.
Bring condition-removal against long chill.
tactic=melee
Clear turrets or use projectile defenses.
Spread around the boss to avoid having multiple people hit by his cone. Bring a condition cleanse for when his frost aura runs out.
tactic=coordinated
One player can hold the cutscene allowing other to prepare, use a teleport or movement skill to stand near Frost while holding the cutscene to benefit from pre-stacking.
Fight on top of Frost. Use anti-projectile skills to avoid having to kill the rockets, and burst Frost down.
tactic=exploit
Frost's chill-cone attack can only hit horizontally. There are numerous areas where you can jump up and avoid being hit by this attack; most of these areas will also protect you from the rockets and golems.
tactic=rewards
There is a very low chance to get an account bound wiki=Spineguard_of_the_North from enemy=Frost. It's account bound so it's not valuable.

name=Start
tactic=normal|skip
Talk to enemy=Exemplar_Talie:ally and choose to look for the Seraph. Follow her to the manor and take the stairs on your left. Kill two enemy=Cutpurses:elite. They both can inflict 12 stacks of bleeding so take condition removal.
The first room on right has two enemy=Rifle_Turrets:structure, two enemy=Net_Turrets:structure and enemy=Taylor:champion. You need to kill Taylor so you can push a button on the wall to open the next door.
tactic=normal
Focus the turrets down first. Net Turrets can permanently immobilize you so try to dodge their attack if you want to get close and take condition removal as a backup.
tactic=skip
Cutpurses can't be skipped easily because they will follow you into the room. Net turrets can be skipped because they can't rotate. Just run to back of the room while dodging to prevent getting immobilized by the Net Turrets.
tactic=normal|skip
Taylor is very easy to kill because of her low damage ouput. Dodge when she shoots rapidly to avoid her burst. Anti-projectile skills are very useful.
tactic=coordinated
Pull the Cutpurses to Taylor and kill them all at the same time.
tactic=exploit
Cutpurses can be skipped if you attack Taylor from media=cmp2_taylor.jpg|bed with either melee or from afk-range spot.
Also if you cleared turrets and cutpurses you can run out of the room to get out of combat regeneration without her reseting.

name=Second room
tactic=normal
Once enemy=Taylor:champion is dead push button at the back of the room and go back into the corridor. The second room on the left side has four enemy=Flame_Turrets:structure and two enemy=Riflemen:elite.
Focus down the Riflemen as they deal high damage. Avoid unnecessary movement because that makes them deal more damage. Reflects and blinds are very useful here.
Once the enemies are dead push the button and go back to the corridor. The last room on the right side has enemy=Medic_Rosina:ally. Talk to her to proceed. Once she is done front door closes but you can still get in through a corridor on south of the building.
tactic=exploit
The turrets and riflemen will spawn after path selection, using ground targetted attacks on the second floor, above the doorway west of Talie, will kill them.

name=Curing enemy=Rosina:ally
tactic=normal
To cure Rosina you have to get her satchel from the spike room. Go back to the stairs where 7 enemies have appeared. In the main room there is enemy=Marius, a enemy=Cutpurse:elite, a enemy=Scatter_Shot:elite and a enemy=Hooligan:elite. On the opposing stairs there are two enemy=Riflemen:elite, a enemy=Bomber:elite and two enemy=Net_Turrets:structure.
Keep in mind that Riflemen have very high attack range so they will shoot you if you fight the first group in the open. You should pull the first group behind any corner to break line of sight on Riflemen. Focus down Cutpurse and Scatter_Shot because of their high damage output. Reflects are very strong against Scatter Shots.
When approaching the second group you should have an immunity skill or anti projectile skills to prevent getting immobilized and shot to death. Use area attacks to quickly clear out the enemies.
tactic=warrior
Use wiki=Shield_Stance while approaching the second group to tank attacks. You can swap shield to some other weapon during the channel.
tactic=skip
The bomber and 2 riflemen can't be skipped because Rosina won't accept her satchel (or move from the room) until they are killed.
Marius and the elites will aggro to you from the room due to the small distance between the mobs.
tactic=coordinated
Run accross the stairs to the second group of enemies, and kill all the mobs while using projectile defense and stability. This is easily accomplished by stealthing across, however it can also be accomplished by running across and dodging.
tactic=exploit
Second group can't move so you can run through them and hide behind a corner while waiting for skills to recharge.
You can turn right immediately after the 3 elites at the top of the stairs and attack them with AoEs/melee attacks while standing behind the corner.

name=Spike room
tactic=normal|skip
Don't rush into the next room. Uncovered areas of the floor have spike traps on them. Moving on the floor will quickly get you killed. You can safely move on carpets and pillows. There are also a enemy=Riflemen:elite and a enemy=Bomber:elite in the room.
tactic=normal
Jump over the small gap to the first carpet. Use ranged attacks to kill the enemies (run back if you need health). Once they are dead, throw pillows on the floor and jump over. Go forward and remember to jump over small gaps. Grab the medical kit and take it to enemy=Rosina:ally.
tactic=skip
Jump over the small gap to the first carpet. Use stability and immunity to tank hits from the enemies. Use a leap or a teleport (target enemy if needed) to get over the floor. Jump over small gaps, grab the medical kit from the chest and take it to enemy=Rosina:ally.

For any class with a blink, you can enter the room below where the medical kit is located and blink through the floor. This is much more efficient than moving through the spike room.
tactic=coordinated
One player gets the medical kit (using Skip tactic). Everyone else goes back to the starting waypoint after suiciding on the spike traps.
tactic=skip|coordinated
Jump along the trim of the wall to avoid touching the floor. Party members can use blinds, projectile defenses, blocks, or drawing aggro to allow a player to safely reach the chest.
tactic=warrior
Use wiki=Savage_Leap to jump over the gap.
tactic=warrior
Use wiki=Balanced_Stance and wiki=Defiant_Stance to tank hits.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Judge's_Intervention to teleport over the gap.
tactic=thief
Use wiki=Steal to teleport over the gap.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Blink to teleport over the gap.
tactic=elementalist
Use wiki=Lightning_Flash to teleport over the gap.

name=Way to Bridgette
tactic=normal|skip
Once the NPC has the medical kit the front door will open. Go back to the start.
tactic=normal
| Proceed slowly when approaching the waypoint. You will get ambushed by 4 enemy=Scouts:elite. Pull them a bit back because at low health they will run away and alert the rifleman and 2 other enemies near the stable.
Pull next enemy group behind a corner to force them to melee. Be careful when approaching because the enemy=Rifleman:elite will start shooting.
tactic=skip
Keep running forward past the waypoint. Hide behind a wall after aggroing all mobs, kill all 7 before continuing.
tactic=coordinated
Run past the 4 cutpurses to the 3 ranged enemies, use blinds/projectile defenses and kill all 7.
Stealth through and path the 4 cutpurses. Run past the other 3.

name=enemy=Bridgette:legendary
tactic=melee|ranged
Kill normal enemies first and then focus Bridgette. She will stand still on her Symbols which give either retalation, regeneration or causing nearby allies to inflict burning on attacks. You should run behind a tree to make her come out of them (no need to try if you know she isn't aggroed on you).
tactic=ranged
Stay at range so she won't attack you.
tactic=melee
Stay at max melee range so she won't attack you. You are forced to take damage if she is standing on her symbol so watch out. Absolute max melee will not be hit by her symbols, however you want to bring her out of retaliation symbols be breaking line of sight.
tactic=melee|ranged
| If you get to low health, stop attacking so you don't get killed by retaliation. Ignore her summoned Sword unless it starts attacking.
tactic=coordinated
Focus Bridgette and cleave normal enemies. Keep her out of her symbols by breaking line of sight behind trees. You may also use control for same effect. Stay at max melee range so she won't attack.
tactic=solo
Use long range attacks to draw the mobs in and clear them, or pull Bridgette and kill any other mobs. Stand at the edge of her symbol and face 90 degrees from her, melee her and her swords, stop attacking during retaliation symbols.
You can draw her to the staircase of the building next to you, while standing on the edge of the landing, the swords may spawn beneath you and fail to connect with their strikes. She can only have 1 sword summoned at a time if you leave it alive.
tactic=exploit
You can draw her out of the small clearing and stand on the stable to range her without fear of her swords.

name=To closed gate
tactic=normal
Ther are two ways to proceed. Stick to right and fight a enemy=Hound:legendary + some Elites. Or go to the left side and fight a bit more Elites.
You should go to left because the ranged enemies from left side will shoot when you are trying to pick up powder kegs. So you may have to kill them while also fighting enemies at door. Additionally, the Hound is a long and moderately difficult fight.
tactic=coordinated
Stealth and run past the hound. Re-stealth before you pick up any kegs to avoid being shot at by the other Elites.

name=Closed gate
tactic=normal
You need to place 5 kegs at circles near door to explode it. Enemies constantly respawn and try to bring kegs back. You have few ways to do it:
1-2 players should put kegs at random places to distract enemies. They can also kill enemies. The rest of the players should keep running kegs over and over.
tactic=warrior
Consider using wiki="Fear_Me!" or/and wiki=Stomp to protect kegs.
tactic=coordinated
Coordinate keg-drop (needs stealth or voice communication). Everyone grabs a keg and runs to their own circle. Then drop the kegs at the same time.
After destroying the gate, run through it and turn right, hiding behind one of the wall supports to clear the mobs.
Before dropping the kegs reapply stealth using a non-field skill, turn left immediately after the gate and run through the gauntlet before stealth runs out.
tactic=exploit
Put a keg inside of a house on a table (or any other unreachable place), or on top of a rock that is unreachable without jumping. All the enemies run to it and try to grab it (but they can't reach it). Then just coordinate keg-drop, the enemies will run towards you but stop part way and go back to the first keg.

name=Big group with cannons
tactic=normal
All enemies are stationary ranged attackers. If you attack at range you can reduce amount of enemies attacking you.
First group shouldn't give much problems. After that wait for Champion to come close and pull it away from big group.
Then focus enemies from big group one by one.
tactic=melee
Use projectile defenses on top of each group to fight from safetey, use trees to hide from other groups while waiting on cooldowns, or retreat towards the gate to break aggro.
tactic=skip
Just run through everything.
tactic=coordinated
Stealth and run through everything.

name=enemy=Turmaine:legendary
tactic=normal
He is very easy to kill as long as people can stay out of his wells. They appear all over the area and inflicts chill then poison, so pay attention and equip some Condition removal. Avoid getting downed at all costs because reviving is very difficult.
Occasionally he turns invulnerable and start chasing people. Keep running away and dodge when he is close.
tactic=coordinated
Bait out his invulnerability, and when it ends quickly burst him down. CC him if you expect he will soon go invulnerable again.
tactic=exploit
He can be bugged in the treehouse (lure him up and jump down) or on a rock (attack him and run over it). This allows him to be ranged without worrying about his plague form.
tactic=warrior
Take wiki=Signet_of_Stamina to clear lots of conditions at the same time.
Use wiki=Rush or/and wiki=Whirlwind_Attack to get away from him during plague form.
tactic=rewards
There is a very low chance to get an account bound wiki=Recipe:_Plague from enemy=Turmaine. The recipe allows you to craft wiki=Plague_(ring)|Plague which gives better gold return for your tokens.

name=enemy=Sure-Shot_Seamus:legendary
tactic=melee|ranged
Focus 3 enemy=Enforcers:elite before attacking him because at 95% health he will switch from Pistols to a Shotgun and become much more dangerous. You can run around the building if needed.
With Shotgun he will knocklock which can easily kill you. Take stability or stun breaks as a fail safe. His big weakness is that he has to stop briefly before shooting, thus allowing a player to simply sidestep his attack.
tactic=ranged
| He can't hit you at 900+ range so stay away from him. If he aggroes on you, you can either keep running or go to melee range.
tactic=ranged|melee
| At melee range you can keep circling and he won't be able to hit you. Once you get good at it you should try to direct his shots away from other people.
tactic=coordinated
Fight on top of Sure Shot. You should open the fight with projectile defense (ideally a reflect like Wall of Reflection). Once the boss switches to his Shotgun, it is ideal for a Guardian or Mesmer to provide group stability. At which point, the boss can be CCed (e.g. Deep Freeze) and quickly DPSed down.

name=Corridor of Riflemen
tactic=normal|skip
The area at the start of the corridor 3 enemy=Cutpurses:elite, 2 enemy=Rifle_Turrets:structure and 2 enemy=Net_Turrets:structure. The first room on the left has 3 enemy=Archers:elite, a enemy=Cutpurse:elite and 2 enemy=Flame_Turrets:structure. The second room on left has 2 enemy=Flame_Turrets:structure. At the end of corridor there are 2 enemy=Riflemen:elite and a enemy=Bomber:elite.
tactic=normal
Pull Cutpurses out so you won't get shot by Riflemen. Destroy Turrets. Aggro enemies in first room and run back to pull that Cutpurse. Go together to the first room and kill Archers (careful to not get hit by Riflemen).
Then either go to second room or attack the 2 Riflemen and the Bomber.
tactic=skip
Run to the second room (Flame Turrets can't rotate and won't attack you). Kill the Cutpurse if she is following you.
tactic=normal|skip
| Stick to the left side and push secret button like in story mode.
tactic=coordinated
Stealth through and press the button.
tactic=exploit
You can attack 2 of the 3 elites at the end of the hallway through the wall next to the flame turrets in the second room.

name=Rockets Turrets and Air Guns
tactic=normal
Everyone should pick an Air Gun. All of the skills will reflect turret rockets back. Be careful because a few rockets will kill you. You should proceed slowly to reduce the risk. Dodge back if your skills are on cooldown.
You can't reflect rockets or hit turrets with any other skill. Door will open once every Turret is destroyed.
tactic=coordinated
Stack might and drop a Shadow Refuge before pressing the button and picking up air guns. This is the only place in the game where increasing your power will cause your reflected projectiles to hit for more damage. Run into the middle of the turrets while stealthed, and drop a reflect before stealth runs out, as it will project you from any rockets you don't reflect with your guns (although it will not deal damage). Use the guns to reflect rockets and kill the rocket turrets. Use additional antiprojectile skills if necessary.

name=enemy=Wahlen:legendary
tactic=normal
Pull Wahlen and the bandits outside the room behind the door, or inside the room behind the wooden structure.
Wahlen is easy at range because you can just walk left/right or dodge. At close range he will spin and throw lots of bombs.
tactic=coordinated
Fight on top of Wahlen. Pull enemies in with Temporal Curtain or Binding Blades.
Provide a projectile defence as well as aegis/stability if the boss is not CCed to avoid being kicked back.
tactic=exploit
1-2 players can use Air Guns to reflect all his attacks back for massive damage.

name=Spike corridor
tactic=normal
There are multiple enemy=Spike_Traps:trap in the corridor. 2 enemy=Riflemen:elite and a enemy=Bomber:elite at end. Traps get disabled when someone gets through the door.
You should look for an opening and then go together because the Riflemen can easily shoot down a lone target. Use mobility, leaps, stealth and teleports to get through more easily.
tactic=exploit
The traps won't activate until enemy=Wahlen:legendary dies. You can run to end of the corridor right before he dies to easily disable the traps.

name=Big room with lots of enemies.
tactic=normal
You can kill first two big groups. But it will take a long time and is risky. Instead you should run through.
Stick to right side to avoid aggro. Run along the platform and simply jump down (this also breaks aggro).
Keep running on right side until the end and jump down. Once you aggro 2 enemy=Riflemen:elite 4 more will appear. Quickly run underneath platform and around the corner to force them into melee range.
tactic=skip
Just run through everything straight to the end boss.
tactic=coordinated
Stealth through everything.
tactic=exploit
If you wipe and have problems you can easily range Riflemen from the platform above them.

name=Corridor + another big room
tactic=normal
Pull patrol away from 2 enemy=Riflemen:elite. Pull enemy group away from 2 Riflemen. Kill those 2 Riflemen. Kill last 6 enemies.
tactic=coordinated
Ignore these enemies. Simply stealth past then.

name=enemy=Vallog:legendary
tactic=melee|ranged
Kill the enemy=Bandit_Riflemen:elite. You can cleave the farthest two by standing between them.
tactic=ranged
Keep distance so you won't get hit by his melee attack. Watch out for wind effect because it will reflect your projectiles. Either stop attacking or do not use reflectable attacks. Dodge if he shoots fireball at you.
tactic=melee
Watch out for his animations. Dodge when he hops left because he will hit everything around him. If he is facing you with fiery effect dodge his ranged attack. You can probably ignore wind effect because it only reflects projectiles, but be aware if you have any melee attacks that involve projectiles (Such as Whirling Wrath for Guardians).
tactic=coordinated
Place a projectile defense on top of the boss, provide aegis/stability to the group when he steps left and interrupt his swirling winds.
tactic=rewards
There is a very low chance to get an account bound wiki=Recipe:_Vallog's_Demise from enemy=Vallog. The recipe allows you to craft wiki=Vallog's_Demise which gives much better gold return for your tokens.
