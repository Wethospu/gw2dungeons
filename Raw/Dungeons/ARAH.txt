Guarding the exit from the open area are 4 enemy=text:Risen|Elementalist:elite|Hunter:elite|Illusionist:elite|Risen_Mage:elite.
After you skip them, you can either stick to the left or the right side. Watch out for 3 enemy=Vile_Oozes:elite which will spawn on the way. In the middle of the path there are 2 enemy=Orrian_Drakes:elite, with two more further up the road.
After reaching a small slope, more than a dozen of enemy=Lesser_Oozes_(Fighting):normal will appear. At the end of the corridor there are three additional enemy=Drakes:elite.
Keep running forward, ignoring enemy=Crystalline_Entities:champion. Once you reach the back wall, most enemies will lose aggro, though you may have to kill a few that have not.
It is easy to die during the skip. You can easily clear the enemy=Drakes:elite and enemy=Lesser_Oozes_(Fighting):normal and ressurect any party members that died towards the end. If a party member died earlier they should waypoint back. In such situations, killing the enemy=Drakes:elite and enemy=Lesser_Oozes_(Fighting):normal is advised in order to make skipping easier for those that died.

tactic=normal
The objective is to kill the nine enemy=Crystalline_Entities:champion wandering around the area. They are resistant to damage and conditions.
In order to be able to damage them, you need a debuff which is acquired by standing in the spots where a green light is shining through the roof of the cave. The more stacks you have, the more damage you will deal, be advised, however, that each stack deals damage to you every second.
The enemy=Entities:champion are extremely easy to kill if you play as a team. Group together at the first light spot and wait until everyone in the team has at least five stacks. If you attack immediately with one or two stacks, you will barely do any damage. Try not to aggro more than 3 at a time and burst them down quickly.
They only have one basic melee attack but they can quickly kill you if you try to tank them. Stay mobile and keep kiting them inside the light, with proper movement they should not be able to hit you at all.
If you take too much damage and the stacks are about to kill you, just step out of the light. If possible, use mobility skills to quickly break aggro. If you keep kiting them outside of the light other players will have a hard time hitting them (especially melee players).
Once they are dead, do not forget to get your chest near the Jotun spirit NPC.

If you stick to the right near the wreck of the ship, you will be ambushed by 3 enemy=Orrian_Spiders:elite, 5 enemy=Orrian_Spiders:normal and an enemy=Orrian_Spider:champion.

Wait for rest of the team before going to the area with geysers. Spread over the area and quickly clean up 4 corpses by walking over them when at full health. Ignore "300 years old Whiskey" bundle on the ground because its burning has a very low duration.
After a while, four geysers will activate and start spawning enemy=Tars:normal. In order to stop them from spawning, a player has to stand on a geyser. To spawn the boss, four players have to stand on the four geysers. Step on them as fast as possible to avoid getting overrun. When the boss appears, the geysers stop spawning Tars so you can safely get off them.
The boss is rather easy to defeat as long as your team can maintain constant burning. enemy=Shoggroth:legendary has just one attack which causes multiple unblockable AoEs. If the boss is not burning, each AoE will spawn a Tar and stepping on those AoEs will give you the "Covered in Tar" debuff which disables you completely for 1 minute (downed state is the only way to break it). If the boss is on fire, its attack only causes burning, though this burning has a long duration and might down players in teams with low sustainability.
Focus enemy=Tars:normal to reduce pressure and remember to rally off of them. Every 25% enemy=Shoggroth:legendary will hide, which will activate the geysers again. Quickly stand on 3 geysers to prevent lots of Tars from appearing. Keep the last one open if there are lots of Tars to kill or if anyone needs to be healed or resurrected.

tactic=normal
Intended way is to use a nearby asuran golem and chargers lying around it to get through. However in some cases it might be easier to run without it, especially if you have access to stealth.
One player gets inside the golem and one player charges it with a charger. Charging the golem gives it "Energized" buff which allows it to use the buff to create a protecting shield. This buff doesn't stack so charging him while buff is up just wastes the charger.
Decide initial charging order to avoid wasting charges. Pay attention to the buff on golem. When it disappears the first player uses his charger. When it disappears again the second player uses his charger. Once all 4 initial charges have been used you should be pretty far already. Newer players should use their charger first because it's easy to lose focus and mess up.
Before grabbing a charger use any area swiftness or vigor skill to get through faster. When golem dodges it will make a short dash allowing it to move faster. When buffs are up pick up a charger and proceed quickly to avoid buffs wearing off.
Golem user should keep up the protective shield at all times so stay near him. After using your charger look for a new one. Chargers are scattered along the corridor. However remember to use any area buffs before picking up.
Take revival skills to get people up fast if they get down. If you stop to revive them normally you will get killed. When you get through the corrifor, enemies should focus a flashing beacon nearby. Sometimes 2 enemy=Orrian_Spiders:elite will follow you, just kill them at range.
If someone didn't get through and he can't skip it alone, you have to proceed without him or waypoint back.

name=enemy=Berserker_Abomination:legendary
tactic=normal|coordinated
Very easy to kill if you can avoid its attacks. 3 enemy=Handlers:normal respawn in the area. They drop Tranquilizer Guns upon death. You should fight the boss behind a pair of stones near the entrance to the area to LoS the Handlers.
The enemy=text:Abomination's|Abomination:legendary normal attack is so slow that you can just run through it to avoid being hit. Dodge if unsure because of high damage it deals.
When it jumps up you must dodge, otherwise you will be launched and take extreme damage. Staying at range is a bit risky because the Abomination will throw rocks with an unreliable hitbox at ranged players. It can hit for extreme damage even if it seems like it missed.
Occasionally, the enemy=Abomination:legendary will enter into berserker mode during which it turns red and becomes much bigger. It does not take any damage and constantly applies strong burning at close range. Shoot it with a Tranquilizer Gun to remove the buff but keep in mind that tranquilizing interrupts animations, be prepared to dodge rocks, stomps or autoattacks without animations.

The most efficient way to stop it from berserkering is to interrupt it with typical control skills.

A enemy=Risen_Hunter:elite and about twelve normal Risen patrol the area. It is advised to kill them for loot and to gain sigil stacks. Try to LoS them by standing in the right corner of the wall. Further on the way there is a enemy=Risen_Berserker:elite which you can skip.
In the big open area there are a lot of exploding corpses, enemy=Orrian_Guard_Turrets:structure, enemy=Risen_Illusionists:elite, enemy=Risen_Hunters:elite, enemy=Risen_Mages:elite, enemy=Risen_Elementalists:elite and a enemy=Orrian_Warrior:champion.

Killing them takes a lot of time so you should try to sneak through. Stick to the left side and take out enemy=Turrets:structure, preferably by utilizing projectile reflection or absorption.

name=enemy=Wraithlord's_Crusher:legendary and enemy=Wraithlord's_Hunter:champion
tactic=normal
Whole battle is based on avoiding enemy=text:Crusher's|Crusher:legendary one-hit channeled melee attack. It's a very slow and well telegraphed move. However, there are two mechanics that makes this fight harder. Most important is the presence of enemy=Hunter:champion that can immobilize you with two of his attacks and cover it with poison which he uses with his other attack. enemy=text:Hunter's|Hunter:champion basic ranged attack bounces and hits 3 times. Last hit will immobilize for 7 seconds. If you get his aggro you should stay away from others to not get them immobilized. When he glows he either shoots poison gas at enemy=Crusher:legendary or shoots slow projectile which immobilizes (easy to avoid with movement). If targeted at close range, he will dodge back and lay immobilizing trap. Dodge towards him or simply attack him without having him as a target.
enemy=Crusher:legendary has a minor healing ability and his shouts resurrect dead allies (this includes enemy=Hunter:champion) and transfer all conditions to nearby enemies so using immobilize on him is counterproductive. To survive easily, make you sure you have 3-4 ways to counter immobilize (either good condition-removal, block, evade, teleport or immunity). Keep in mind that single blocks like wiki=Riposte will not protect your from enemy=Crusher:legendary if you are in melee range. If you have party members that are using range weapons from a distance, try to force it to slam in opposite direction of them.
The usual tactic is to focus enemy=Crusher:legendary because he will resurrect enemy=Hunter:champion otherwise. However, when the former dies, all enemies it resurrected will die too. So hit enemy=Hunter:champion too if possible. You can also focus on enemy=Hunter:champion first because once he gets resurrected he will no longer use poison Cloud and once you kill enemy=Crusher:legendary, enemy=Hunter:champion will die as well.
#######################################

You can pull enemy=Crusher:legendary away from enemy=Hunter:champion if you have pulled and killed starting enemies away from their spawn point (even if he resurrects them you will be safe as long as they do not get aggroed).

The next part is filled with mostly elite Risen. There are six groups of 4 enemy=text:Risen|Elementalist:elite|Hunter:elite|Illusionist:elite|Mage:elite. You should pull those groups very carefully. Using projectile reflections helps extremely against enemy=Risen_Elementalists:elite and enemy=Risen_Hunters:elite. Move towards the South while clearing 4 groups of elite Risen.
#######################################
tactic=skip
This part is very often skipped but this skip is one of the harder in Arah because of the elite Risen which like to inflict long lasting Chill and tight space. There are four groups of 4 enemy=text:Risen|Elementalist:elite|Hunter:elite|Illusionist:elite|Mage:elite. At the start stick to left side, wait for patrol to move out of way and quickly move to the ledge above. Then skip normally by using typical skipping methods.
#######################################
tactic=fight|skip
After a while you will face 2 another groups of elite Risen and enemy=Orrian_Spiders:normal if you keep moving forward. Both of those two groups are avoidable if you move between their aggro range. Turn the left immediately after those two groups and stick to the left side (there are enemy=Risen_Hands:structure nearby).

On the wide area there is patrolling a enemy=Giant:champion. There are also a lot of enemy=Risen_Hands:structure which occasionaly will throw a rock that knocks you down. There are 3 entrance to the area of the next boss. Two of them (left and right) appear unguarded but in fact you will be ambushed by enemy=Orrian_Spider:champion and 2 enemy=Orrian_Spiders:elite.

If you get caught you should either just die or run away from everyone else so you won't get them killed.

If your team has high uptime of anti projectiles skills this boss is very easy to defeat. His basic attack is hard hitting slow projectiles that inflicts high amount of damage and poison. If you stay in melee it's very difficult to dodge it and everyone in melee needs to do it. On top of that there are multiple respawning enemy=Risen_Hands:structure which knock you down with their rocks. That's where anti projectiles comes handy.
#######################################
tactic=normal
Without anti projectiles skills he is dangerous with his strong basic attack. This basic attack is hard hitting slow projectiles that inflicts high amount of damage and poison. If you stay in melee it's very difficult to dodge it and everyone in melee needs to do it. On top of that there are multiple respawning enemy=Risen_Hands:structure which knock you down with their rocks. Stay mobile and move in zig zag pattern to avoid most of them. You should have a stun breaker to save you from dangerous situations. If you want to melee him as a group you need to either block or use anti projectiles skills. You can dodge it but everyone needs to do it then. Alternatively, just the person that has his aggro could attack him from range while the rest can attack him from melee range.
#######################################
tactic=normal|coordinated
enemy=Mage_Crusher:legendary often plants marks which have no initial effect. After he jumps in the air they explode dealing high damage to everyone standing on top of them. Dodge or simply move out of them if there's a room for that.

name=Way to Vahid
tactic=normal
First you will see moving green glowing balls. Just avoid them because they kill quite fast. After that you get ambushed by ~4 enemy=Vile_Oozes:elite. Then ~5 elite Spectral enemies and then bit more green glowing balls. After that a group of ~5 elite Risen. They are quite hard to kill so people just skip them.

name=enemy=Vahid,_High_Priest_of_Melandru:legendary
tactic=ranged|melee
The room has 3 enemy=Orrian_Gorillas:elite at the middle. They keep respawning so you shouldn't kill them unless your group has a high damage. Instead, dedicate one player to kite them at back of the room. Kiting them is pretty easy with swiftness and a stun break as a back up.
Rest of the players should use buckets on tree stumps which are located on small rooms. Successful usage causes a tree to appear which starts shooting glowing balls to middle. After reviving all trees Vahid will appear at the middle. He is surrounded by lots of moving green balls which knock you back and deal lots of damage on hit.
tactic=ranged
Use weapons with a high range and try to find a spot where green balls don't move.
tactic=melee
Consider using ranged weapons. Melee is very hard and unforgiving unless you have a good team and can find the safe spot from green balls. He has an attack which launches nearby targets so you need to have stability, blocks or evades which don't make you move. If you move you may get killed by green balls.
tactic=ranged|melee
He occasionally summons enemy=Trees which apply immobilized once in a while. With Gorillas away it's nothing to worry about. Summon also has some initial damage so avoid falling asleep.
tactic=coordinated
Stack at the melee safe spot. Use group stability so you don't launched or knocked down by Gorillas. Burst the boss and Gorillas down.
Alternative safer tactic is to kill Gorillas first and then move to the melee spot. If Gorillas manage to respawn, move back to kill them again.

name=Way to Farnaz
tactic=normal
You will get ambushed by ~4 enemy=text:Risen|Elementalist:elite|Hunter:elite|Illusionist:elite|Mage:elite. If you want to skip them you need to move really fast, use stealth or burst really hard.
At the end of road there is a closed door. You need to kill enemy=undead_abomination:elite to open it. Rally from normal Risen if needed.
After gate you will end up on wide area. There is patrolling a enemy=Giant:champion. There are also lots of enemy=Risen_Hands:structure. There are 3 ways to go on, left, forward or right. Forward is never used because it has a group of 6 elite Risen and 6 normal Risen.
On both left and right way you get ambushed by a enemy=Orrian_Spider:champion and 2 enemy=Orrian_Spiders:elite. Left way is often used because you can more easily lose aggro by running to nearby ledge (right next to Mage Crusher). These enemies should be easy to skip.

name=enemy=Farnaz,_High_Priestess_of_Lyssa:legendary
tactic=normal
She is really easy with party wide condition removal and if you pay attention. When she summons clones she will shatter them and cause 25 confusion party wide. You can kill yourself in seconds so stop attacking and remove them.
Her basic ranged attack does some damage and inflicts conditions but should not be a threat. When she glows purple she morphs one player to a Moa. Try to dodge it. She also summons illusions based on targets profession, just cleave/AoE them.
tactic=bug
Farnaz may not spawn if Whispers Agent died during her dialogue or something similar. To prevent it, use stealth to skip spiders or lose aggro before approaching the statue. There is no known fix.

When you reach the door you have to kill 2 enemy=Undead_Abominations:elite. Their charge is really dangerous so get out of its way or interrupt them. Their attacks are slow so you can easily dodge them all. Focus enemy=Abominations:elite even if you aggro something. Once they are dead, the door opens and you can run in. It should be easy to kill any following enemies then.

This boss fight consists of 3 distinct phases. In the first phase, enemy=Lupicus:legendary remains mostly stationary and does three different moves (but one is only used if you are within melee range). If you want to play it safe and simply range it, have your party stack in one spot. Its first move, the roar, summons 0-4 enemy=Locusts:elite which will start moving towards your group. They can only damage you if you stay stationary but if you have 1-3 people with melee weapons you can kill them really fast when they come within your melee range.

This boss fight consists of 3 distinct phases. In the first phase, enemy=Lupicus:legendary remains mostly stationary and does three different moves. Its first move, the roar, summons 0-4 enemy=Locusts:elite which die really fast to cleave damage. They can only damage you if you remain stationary so try to stay mobile throughout the whole phase.
Its next attack is the kick. enemy=Lupicus:legendary leans on his left foot before kicking but it is quite fast, making it difficult for inexperienced players to dodge. Try to predict it - if it does not do anything for about 3s he might try to kick. This move can instantly down players with low defensive stats.
#######################################
tactic=ranged|melee|coordinated
Its last skill infects the targeted player. Infected players glow with a dark green light. After roughly 4s this player will be knocked down for about 5s and spawn an inactive enemy=Grub_(passive), which will move towards enemy=Lupicus:legendary, and get eaten by it after a few seconds (or immediately after enemy=Lupicus:legendary finishes its current animation if you are in melee). This will give him 1 stack of Empower, granting him more damage and armor. What you have to do is to either dodge or use an immunity skill (this skill is unblockable) when his hand is up to prevent the infection. If you fail to do so, burst the grub down before it starts moving.
At 75% HP, after finishing its current animation, enemy=Lupicus:legendary turns invulnerable for 5s and infects the closest target (even NPCs, this infection is unavoidable), entering phase 2.

tactic=ranged
Try to kill the last enemy=Grub_(passive) but if not possible let enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary eat it. Kill any remaining enemy=Locusts:elite. enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary has 4 different abilities.
Its first attack is the Dash. It shadowsteps slowly towards an enemy, damaging and knocking down everyone nearby upon reaching its target. A simple dodge or block is enough to avoid it.
Its next move is Lupine Blast. It is a slow-moving projectile which can either be dodged at closer range or evaded by zig zagging when at higher range. If you stay within melee range, this attack cannot hit you.
Its close range move, mighty Blow, is very distinct and is often used after enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary finishes his Dash and someone gets knocked down.
Its last and most dangerous attack is Frenzied Blast. enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary puts its hands on its chest, launching a barrage of projectiles all over the arena. Those projectiles first hit those standing closer to it, hitting targets in melee range almost immediately. Projectiles also come in 3 waves. On top of that, if more than 2 players are fighting enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary, some red circles are not drawn, and at long range the circles might disappear before the projectiles hit the ground. To counter this move, try to either move towards him while dodging or move towards the walls of the arena. You may also use block/immunity skills and anti projectiles skills, but keep in mind that personal reflects are ineffective if you do not use them in conjunction with immunity skills. Prepare to dodge Lupine Blast afterwards as he may use it shortly after finishing casting Frenzied Blast.
At 50% HP, enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary once again turns invulnerable, casts a less dangerous version of Frenzied Blast and enters Phase 3.
#######################################
tactic=melee
First thing you should do is kill the last enemy=Grub_(passive). Usually, there are two ways of dealing with it. Either get some distance from enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary and burst it while waiting for Frenzied Blast, or use anti projectiles skills and kill the grub before enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary finishes its animation.
This phase is really straightforward and fast if your team has projectile reflections. enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary has 4 different attacks.
Its first attack is the Dash. enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary shadowsteps slowly towards an enemy, damaging and knocking down everyone nearby upon reaching its target. A simple dodge or block is enough to avoid it. If your whole team is in melee range, he will never use it unless on an NPC.
Its next move is Lupine Blast. It is a slow-moving projectile but still hard to dodge at close range. Try to keep anti projectile skills up so you don't have to worry about this.
Its close range move, mighty Blow, has a distinct and slow animation - enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary swipes with its arms. It is possible to simply move through it behind its back with swiftness to completely avoid its damage. Otherwise, a dodge is enough.
Its last and most dangerous attack is Frenzied Blast, especially so if you are in melee range. enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary puts its hands on its chest,launching a barrage of projectiles all over the arena. Those projectiles first hit those standing closer to it, hitting targets in melee range almost immediately. Projectiles also come in 3 waves. On top of that, if more than 2 players are fighting enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary, some red circle are not drawn, and at long range the circles might disappear before the projectiles hit the ground. To counter this move, use your AoE projectile reflects, duration-based blocks, immunity skills or dodge twice. Projectile reflects are extremely effective here and it is even possible to immediately trigger phase 3 if the whole party stays in melee range.
At 50% HP, enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_2):legendary once again turns invulnerable, casts a less dangerous version of Frenzied Blast and enters Phase 3.

name=enemy=Giganticus_Lupicus_(Phase_3):legendary
tactic=ranged|melee
After the transition enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_3):legendary will start to chase its targets, It will still use Lupine Blast, albeit not as frequently. Apart from Lupine Blast, enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_3):legendary replaces its moveset with 4 new moves.
Its first new skill is an Life Drain during which it will rise in the air and float for a few seconds. This ability hits every target in range twice every second. Try to get outside its range as fast as possible, utilize dodges, teleports and other mobility skills. You can also use this attack as an opportunity to go out of combat for a brief period of time as enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_3):legendary will not reset that quickly.
Its next move is called Life Drink. enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_3):legendary makes a horizontal motion with its right arm. Since this attack hits 4 times in 2s, targeted player has to dodge twice, use 2s blocks or both to completely negate the damage, which is high enough to kill most professions. Keep in mind that this attack has much longer range. enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_3):legendary prioritizes ranged players when using this attack. Both this and former attack, as their names suggest, heal it. Should it use them at the very start of phase 3, it is possible for it to heal itself above 50% and go back to phase 2.
Its medium range skill, Frenzied Blast (same name as one of its P2 abilities), shoots multiple projectiles over a medium sized area. Dodge once or twice if you are in the center of its effect, use anti projectiles (personal reflects are ineffective) or simply block with skills that give duration-based blocks. Have in mind that, like all of the Giant's projectiles, those also explode on impact meaning that you can be hit outside of the red circle.
Lastly, its most dangerous attack, called Necrid Trap, as the name suggests, entraps target player and everyone around them, dealing high amounts of damage. The targeted player cannot leave the dome without using stability, immunity skills (blocking does not allow you to leave the trap), normal teleports or using mobility skills in the opposite direction to enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_3):legendary, while non-targeted players can try to dodge outside of the place where the dome is about to appear, combined with the same skills as the targeted player. If you cannot leave the trap, try to use blocks or dodge within the dome without touching its borders to reduce the damage taken. It is also possible to get out of it by using a stunbreaker at the right time when being pushed back inside on contact with the border, but it is very unreliable. enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_3):legendary prioritizes moving and downed players when using this skill, try to remain still as much as possible.
#######################################
tactic=ranged
enemy=Lupicus_(Phase_3):legendary usually focuses on a single target, who might end up downed because of that. Try to revive as fast as possible but make sure you do not get your entire team killed in the process. Try to pull the boss away from downed teammates. Most of its attacks have medium range, making kiting an effective tactic. Keep in mind, however, that it is immune to Cripple and Chill/Immobilize last shorter on it.

Quite tricky to kill because of its strong attacks and lots of enemy=Orrian_Gorillas:elite. Use Staff of Radiance that can be found nearby to lay a trap which stuns it. Cycle it between players to keep him stunned most of the time.
He dashes around which you should avoid. He also has very rapid close range attacks which you should try to predict. After 2 dashes he will try to resurrect nearby enemy=Gorillas:elite.

You need 3-5 Reflecting Crystals to beat him (depends on luck, your damage stats and other sources of reflections). Crystals break randomly on hit so pay attention.
Do not aggro him before everyone is ready and in near vicinity (unless you want to solo it). A Firecircle filling entire room will appear around the Jotun. It will down anyone trying to get in or out. It also gets continuously smaller so keep an eye for it.
enemy=Jotun:legendary mostly shoots homing projectiles. They will instantly kill you on hit and that's where those Reflecting Crystals come handy. Reflect projectiles by holding a Crystal. You should stand on top of the enemy=Jotun:legendary to instantly reflect them, this protects people without Crystals by body blocking a projectile.
When he starts to glow he will cast dangerous AoE. Just dodge when you see the animation.
If you need to revive someone, hold a Crystal and protect them with your body, blocking any incoming projectiles. Also, similarly take care of people without a Crystal.
If you do not have crystal you should still attack enemy=Jotun:legendary normally (hide behind people with a Crystal).

This part can be easily skipped by one person up to the next waypoint but the way is quite long. After leaving the arena you will encounter 2 enemy=Risen_Deadeyes:elite on your right side. Turn into right "alley". At the end of it there will be another 2 enemy=Risen_Deadeyes:elite and then long run to the water. Keep in mind that this area is filled with enemy=Land_Mines:structure. When walked over they will pop in the air and shortly explode dealing extreme damage. This means you can just walk over them but you should not walk right after someone. It's one of the reason why you only one person should do whole skip.
Water-part is filled with enemy=Water_Mines:structure and with enemy=Magma_Turrets:structure which shoot projectiles. Just follow a trail of effects (they give swiftness) while avoiding mines. After them you will face two groups of 2 enemy=Risen_Sharks:normal. Their charge attack can easily down you if you do not pay attention. If you have problems just kill them.
After water you get to a huge mine field. The easiest way to finish it is to turn right shortly after entering the field. This "secret" way bypasses all mines and enemies. Keep sticking to right side to avoid enemies until you reach waypoint.
Your party may now use this waypoint and get to the next boss. Next area is filled with mines meaning you should not move in a group. There are 2 patrols with enemy=Inquest_Technicians:elite and elite Risen. You can get through undetected if you stick to left or right side. Sticking to left side is a bit slower but almost guarantees safe skip. If you stick to the right side you may have to wait a bit if mobs get close. Bring stability to counter stun-lock if you get caught.

name=enemy=Alphard,_Serpent_of_the_Waves:legendary
tactic=melee|ranged|coordinated
Moderately difficult boss without anti projectiles skills.. Conditions expire very fast on her so do not rely on them. Her autoattacks apply one stack of bleeding each but she sometimes uses Unload, a channeled attack, which deals only direct damage.
One of her dangerous move is Throw Anchor which is a similar to that of Kholer's but with less visible cue and much faster activation time. If at least one party member gets pulled she will plant a bomb that explodes after approximately 3 seconds. Avoiding the explosion is a priority during the fight.
Her signature attack, Dagger Storm, is when she flashes and teleports to the middle of the arena. Immediately after she gets a lightning buff icon without any description and starts to spin while shooting projectiles all around the place which bounce and deal extreme damage per hit. They cannot be blocked and dodging is not reliable because they move very fast. During this attack she will also reflect projectiles for the first few seconds. Keep in mind that using summons and pets is not be a good idea because those projectiles may bounce on them which might result in killing you.
Every 25% she spawns 6 enemy=Alphards:normal. If you have a decent uptime of anti projectiles skills you can simply ignore team. If they present a problem just kill them quickly. Remember that you can rally from them in case someone gets downed.
#######################################
tactic=melee
If you want to melee her and you lack anti-projecties skills, the person that has her aggro should kite around the barricades while hitting her. Dodging the pull is extremely important but harder than it is if you attack her from a distance. Try to dodge backward so that you do not get hit by the explosion in the event someone else gets pulled. The second part of the attack, the bomb, is very easy to avoid, just run out of red circle or dodge during explosion animation. One of the way to survive Dagger Storm is to run behind barricades and take cover. It is possible to attack her behind barricades with ranged weapons while jumping. You may also pull her to the entrance where bone wall spawns after you aggroed her, in that case you can simply wait there for her to finish Dagger Storm.
#######################################
tactic=ranged
To defeat her in the least painful way, in the event that your party lacks anti projectiles skills and cannot reliably dodge her pull, lure her to the left side of the area, outside of the arena made by four barricades. There, enemy=Alphard:normal will despawn immediately after spawning and dodging her pull should be much easier because of the distance. Keep randomly strafing to avoid getting hit by her attacks, evade or block the pull and dodge or hide behind the left barricade when she starts to use Dagger Storm.
#######################################
tactic=coordinated
Easiest way to defeat this boss is to melee her under the protection of anti projectiles skills which negate most of her skills. Try to attack her from 130 range, otherwise anti projectiles skills might not work against the pull move. LoS her near the left wall where bone wall spawns after you aggro her. This way you can simply wait safely till she finishes Dagger Storm.

Alphard may immediately reset to full health during the fight. This might happen if people are behind bone wall when Alphard attempts to pull everyone in. Make sure everyone is in the area before you engage.
Also if you wipe, the bone wall may stay up. To prevent it, wait a bit after wipe before waypointing. This may not always work. To fix it do a full party wipe few times or jump over the wall with swiftness.

tactic=skip
One of the harder skips because of vast amount of stuns mobs posses. If someone dies during the run it may be too hard for him to do it alone. It's advised that you wait till you can swap utility skills for the ones that give you stability, consider also elite transformations for long lasting stability. Having a thief helps tremendously.
First group of mobs is composed of 4 enemy=Plague_Carrier_Abomination:elite. They will run towards you and explode dealing high damage and spawning ~10 enemy=Risen_Grubs:normal which are quite harmless. Shortly after there are 2 enemy=Plague_Carrier_Abominations:elite and enemy=Inquest_Technician:elite. There will be also 2 groups of 2 enemy=Inquest_Technicians:elite and 2 enemy=Plague_Carrier_Abominations:elite each circling a big ship wrack. They move counter-clockwise so you should stick to the right side. If you get stunned and die because of enemy=Plague_Carrier_Abominations:elite try to rally on spawned grubs. Those spawned grubs can also start to attack enemy=Inquest_Technician:elite if they lose your aggro making them completely harmless. If you die first part of the second run might be much easier. Also keep in mind that those groups have longer range of aggro.
After that there is a group of enemy=Risen_Defiler:elite, enemy=Risen_Sentinel:elite and 2 enemy=Risen_Berserkers:elite. Watch out for pulls and ring of warding.
Next mobs are 2 groups of 2 enemy=Inquest_Technicians:elite and 2 enemy=Risen_Deadeyes:elite. Really hard to skip if you do not have stability or stealth. On open area there will be lots of patrolling enemy groups. To avoid them all you should hug to the left wall.One patrol may attack you at end so wait until they have went away. Once you see a ledge just jump on it and keep moving.

She is very easy (even solo) as long as you do not try to tank her attacks. She is phased and immune to damage caused by non-phased targets. While she is over 50% you have to use nearby terminal to get phased for 20 seconds and to get huge damage boost. Terminal recharges in 20 seconds so only person can attack her. Same person can't use terminal again until 1 minute has expired so you may have to rotate players. Clones/pets or conditions won't benefit from increased damage so rely on direct damage.
Using the terminal causes enemies to attack the terminal until Brie reaches 50%. That's why killing her fast is top priority because you get teleported out if the terminal gets destroyed. First wave has 3 enemy=Plague_Carriers:elite and a enemy=Technician:elite. Second wave has 2 enemy=Plague_Carriers:elite an 2 enemy=Dominated_Berserkers:elite. Third wave has a enemy=Plague_Carrier:elite, enemy=Dominated_Deadeye:elite and 2 enemy=Dominated_Berserkers:elite.
With offensive build, buffs and boons you can easily kill her in several seconds before any enemies even appearing. Once she reaches 50% you lose the damage bonus and everyone can attack her.
Her normal ranged attack bounces but will not do much damage. When she glows with purple light she will shoot a laser with extreme damage. All you have to do is step aside. There will be also a lot of ticking AoEs in the area. They can easily kill some people. She may also shoot a glowing ball, which is a homing projectile. Try to avoid it by dodging towards its path if you see it coming.

name=The ritual: Cleansing the chicken
tactic=normal
First part of this boss fight is about controling at least 2 out of 3 pillars which shoot balls at the chicken in order to cure it. At the start, control of all 3 pillars belongs to you. Soon after, Wraithlord who is invulnerable and has strong poison aura (stay away from him) will shadowstep towards one random pillar. If you did not send anyone on that point, he will uncap it. On top of that, after ~20 seconds, 6 enemy=Undead_Wraiths:elite appear which will try to uncap more points.
To capture a circle you need to have more players than enemies on it. Same applies to losing the cap. With the same amount of players and enemies on one point its color will change but it's actually not capped. Look at the color of the projectiles shooted from a pillar to be certain. You can stay in a circle even when the boss came as long as you stay near the edge, outside of his poison Aura's range.
The fastest and easiest way is to send 1-2 players while everyone else does not enter the area. When Wraiths appear, sent players should attack them to draw aggro and just kite in the middle. Rest of the players can now enter and cap all pillars (as long as they do not attack anything and get aggro). The players kiting Wraiths in the middle should be aware that the Wraithlord occasionaly spawns a few enemy=Undead_Tendrils:structure which deals some amount of damage, dodge it when you see him channeling an attack. Also, every hit made by Wraith gives one stack of corruption which stuns you after getting every 5th stack.

The fight is really easy as long as you do not stand on his cone attack. It quickly stacks Corruption which makes you take a lot more damage and spawns Wraiths after a certain threshold. Once in a while white spots appear on ground, stand on them to remove stacks of Corruption.
Wraithlord's basic melee attack and enemy=Undead_Tendrils:structure do some damage but also bleeding and poison. Condition removal is good choice for that fight.
If you do not stay in melee range he likes to use a combo that immobilize you (spawns enemy=Undead_Tendrils:structure), then dashes which deals high damage and grants 5 stacks of Corruption (which stuns you as well) and lastly starts to channel his cone attack.

First tower is guarded by few elite Risen, second one by enemy=Orrian_Drakes:normal and enemy=Orrian_Drakes:elite while the last one by enemy=Undead_Grubs:elite and enemy=Undead_Abomination:elite. There's also a enemy=Giant:elite patroling the area between the second and the third tower.

You can do it without aggroing a single enemy by using ranged weapons though the first tower can be destroyed from melee range as well, just stick to the left wall and start attacking it while you get closer to it.

You can avoid getting aggro on the first tower even if you attack in melee range if you stick to the left wall.

For the last tower just use ranged weapons.

tactic=normal
After the gate you will be amushed by few enemy=Orrian_Spiders:normal, enemy=Orrian_Spiders:elite and one enemy=Risen_Elementalist:elite. You will enter new area with 3 groups of mobs (tough 2 are hidden) you should clear before attempting to finish this encounter.
Start with the rightmost group, near a coffin. It's composed of 3 enemy=Undead_Grubs:elite and enemy=Risen_Devastator:elite. Try to focus on Devastator first because of his cc but watch out for small AoEs that Grubs use. After those, go to the middle and kill group of 3 enemy=Undead_Grubs:elite.
Last group is hidden on the left side and is the hardest to deal with - enemy=Risen_Elementalist:elite, enemy=Risen_Mage:elite, enemy=Risen_Illusionist:elite, enemy=Risen_Hunter:elite. Focus Illusionist first.
Once the area is clear (except enemy=undead_wraith_(boss):elite) you should split up on 5 black spots. Your task here is to kill enemy=undead_wraith_(boss):elite to activate statue. Every 10% he teleports to another spot and 2 normal Risen appear. If you do not hit him in few seconds he will reset so you need 1 player at each spot. Wraith reflects projectiles (buff icon) meaning you cannot use them if you want to hit him. However, if you do not have any non-projectiles weapon set pick up "Bone" from ground. It does not matter how fast you kill it as long as you hit it once before he resets. Keep in mind that some quasi-melee attacks are projectiles while some ranged attacks are not. Wraith always teleports in same pattern so you can easily predict its moves. This means melee-oriented players can go assist other players if needed. Obviously, if someone gets downed you should go to help him. If Wraith is at your spot stop attacking it and wait until situation gets better.
Once he is dead, 15 enemy=Risen_Wraiths_(Drain):elite start to appear on black spots over the time (1, 2 or 3 at the same time). Keep killing them and revive people getting drained or killed by Grenth's Mark. Move as a group kill them as fast as possible or if you party has overall high dps you can split once 2 Wraiths start to appear simultaneously.

name=Way to Simin
tactic=skip
Stick to the right side to avoid all enemies. Dodge or use blocks to get through collapsing rocks. Once you get out, stick to left-side and enter the cave with enemy=Sparks:normal.

name=enemy=Simin,_High_Priestess_of_Dwayna:legendary
tactic=normal
At the beginning, there are 5 enemy=Sparks:normal, two of them being friendly, trapped nearby statue. To make enemy=Simin:legendary appears, you ought to lure remaining 3 enemy=Sparks:normal to appropriate position near the statue. But before you do that, you should prepare for the whole fight.
enemy=Simin:legendary has two very distinct mechanics. Firstly, every few seconds she applies "Dead Eyed Stare"-debuff with her ranged attack. While you are under its effect, you move slower and your skills recharge slower as well. After 10s, when it expires, it will petrify debuffed character. The only way to cure this is to throw nearby "Tear of Dwayna" bundle on pefrified team mate. You can also avoid getting petrified by getting stability before "Dead Eyed Stare" ends.
You should designate a "Tear-thrower" whose only task would be to throw Tears on petrified allies. The best player for that is the one with the lowest damage and the highest amount of support. If you have "Simple Party UI" option turn on, swtich it off because simple ui does not display unique debuffs. Pay attention to debuffs and when purple "Dead Eyed Stare" starts to blink, you should prepare to throw a Tear. Green debuff means that an ally is already petrified but you can throw a Tear just before that happens to minimize the time of petrification. You can try attacking enemy=Simin:legendary if you have spare time.
Second distint mechanic she has is her cloak'n'heal. At 50% hp mark she will become invulnerable, invisible and start self-healing. Simultaneously, 5 enemy=Sparks:normal appear and to break her invisibility and stop her from healing, you need to lure all those enemy=Sparks:normal to 5 circles near the central statue. The common tactic here is to assign two people to lure enemy=Sparks:normal while the rest of the part should stick to the wall to avoid getting aggro. One runner should run 3 enemy=Sparks:normal near the start of the cave and the other one should lure 2 enemy=Sparks:normal at the end of the cave. Both runners should posses mobility skills, swiftness and even stability if you usually get Petrified. If one runner keeps getting Petrified, consider switching him for someone else. If she was below ~65% hp when she disappeared, you have 45s to lure sparks and damage her. After that time she will disappear again.
Before the fight starts, decide on where you want to fight enemy=Simin:legendary and bring a lot of Tears so that your "Tear-thrower" does not have to move to pick it up. This boss is not threatening while at the same time having more damage makes whole fight more forgiving. That means you should use melee weapons and potions of undead slaying with offensive food buff. Defensive support can be completely disregarded in favour of offensive one. Be careful with minions/pets/clones because they might aggro enemy=Sparks:normal which makes luring them much harder.
Once the fight starts, try to pull her as close to the wall as possible, then use melee attacks to her towards the wall. Her normal attacks are rather weak but do not stand on AoEs. The deal moderate damage but rarely they will deal much higher damage. Deal enough damage that she will disappear at 50% hp mark. Let your 2 Spark-runners lure enemy=Sparks:normal and damage her again. Repeat this process until she's dead. If you have issues like enemy=Simin:legendary disappearing much faster than after 45s, you should just reset the fight, it may be bugged.
tactic=bug
There have been reports of Simin constantly hiding at 50% health even with high damage and fast spark runs. If this even happens to you, please invite someone really experienced to verify the situation and let me know about it.

Leave the cave and turn left, where there is enemy=Orrian_Drake:champion. Use anti projectiles skills when it leans back and prepares to send insect swarms. If you step on nearby egg, small enemy=Drakes:normal spawns.
Next group is composed of elite Spectrals (2 enemy=Orrian_Spectral_Guards:elite, 2 enemy=Orrian_Spectral_Archers:elite and enemy=Orrian_Spectral_Juggernaut:elite). They use immobilize, cripple, stuns and area of effect skills so prepare accordingly. Focus enemy=Juggernaut:elite first moving then to enemy=Archer:elite. When you finish with them stick to the left side. Before enemy=Undead_Knight:champion there should be a well, you know have two ways to pick.

First way is to jump down into this well. In the water there is a enemy=Risen_Shark:elite which is able to down anyone with its charging attack. Try to dodge it or use stability to decrease the amount of hits his charge would do.
After getting out of the water you will find yourself in some kind of tunnel with 4 enemy=Orrian_Spiders:elite.
Second path is to move past enemy=Undead_Knight:champion, move towards where there is a group of four elite enemy=text:Risen|Elementalist:elite|Illusionist:elite|Hunter:elite|Mage:elite. After them, turn left where there will be 4 enemy=Orrian_Spiders:elite. You will be in area where both of those ways converge.
tactic=fight
There are five elite Spectrals (2 enemy=Orrian_Spectral_Ghostblades:elite, 2 enemy=Orrian_Spectral_Archers:elite and enemy=Orrian_Spectral_Flamecaster:elite) here. Your priority is to kill enemy=Flamecaster:elite first then try to focus on enemy=Ghostblades:elite. Once you take care of them, continue through the passage to end up in the forest with 3 enemy=Orrian_Gorillas:elite. You can kill them or simply ignore them and run past them towards the last boss.
tactic=skip
Now you have another two options to choose. First one is to turn immediately left from the first way and stick to the wall (or run straight ahead if you picked the second path). That way you can sneak past five elite Spectrals (2 enemy=Orrian_Spectral_Ghostblades:elite, 2 enemy=Orrian_Spectral_Archers:elite and enemy=Orrian_Spectral_Flamecaster:elite). Second way is to run past those spectrals. Either way you choose, you will end up in the forest with 3 enemy=Orrian_Gorillas:elite. Just ignore them and run past them towards the last boss.
