name=Instability
tactic=normal|31-40
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Fumbler|Boon_Fumbler: When you dodge roll, you lose all your boons.
Losing both might and fury is a big damage loss so rely on other active defense. Enemies won't hit hard so take bit more sustain and tank attacks instead of dodging.
Don't dodge when running around so you don't lose swiftness.
tactic=normal|41-50
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_No_Pain,_No_Gain|No_Pain,_No_Gain: Enemies recieve random boons when you hit them for critical damage.
Possible boons are aegis, fury, might, protection, regeneration, retaliation and stability.
If eveyone has a high critical chance your party will generate a huge amount of boons. Boon removal can help but the gain is questionable if you sacrifice lots of damage.
Control skills are not effective because enemies will have stability. Condition damage is more effective because enemies will have protection. Take more sustain to counter damage from retaliation.
Bosses can't deal critical hits so fury has no effect. Bosses have a high power and a low healing power so might and regeneration don't have a big effect.
tactic=normal|51-60
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Last_Laugh|Last_Laugh: Enemies explode when killed.
Dodge?
tactic=normal|61-70
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Sluggish|Sluggish: The recharge time of skills you use is increased if you have a condition on you.
You will pretty much always have a condition on you so your skills recharge slower all the time. This will mess up any rotations so to stay effective make sure you know which skills are important to use on cooldown.
tactic=normal|61-80
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Afflicted|Afflicted: Enemies apply random conditions.
Be prepated to get immobilized or feared, especially when fighting enemy groups. Use stability if needed.
tactic=normal|71-90
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Fumbler|Boon_Fumbler: When you dodge roll, you lose all your boons.
Losing both might and fury is a big damage loss so rely on other active defense. Consider taking bit more sustain and tank weaker attacks instead of dodging.
Don't dodge when running around so you don't lose swiftness.
tactic=normal|81-100
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Thieves|Boon_Thieves: Enemies steal boons when they hit you.
Don't use retaliation or you will get everyone killed. Avoid using swiftness to make bosses easier to handle. Be careful with using quickness or resistance.
tactic=normal|91-100
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Social_Awkwardness|Social_Awkwardness: Nearby allies receive agony.
Don't stack as a full group. 4 stacks of agony kills you in 25 seconds even with a max agony resist. If you don't have max agony resist stay away from everyone else.

name=Way to boss
tactic=normal
You will face enemy=Irukandjis:veteran, enemy=Giant_Irukandjis:veteran and enemy=Jade_Shards:veteran.
tactic=normal
| Sometimes killed at lower levels because of good loot.
tactic=normal|skip
Take one stun break to prevent nasty situations.
tactic=skip
If someone falls down he will teleport back downed. Monsters will very likely finish him/her so go help him/her up to prevent unnecessary delay.

name=Awakening
image=http://i.imgur.com/QuxhBdH.jpg
tactic=normal
To wake up Jade Maw you have to kill 2 enemy=Jade_Maw_Tentacles:veteran. Area is filled with respawning enemy=Irukandjis:veteran and enemy=Giant_Irukandjis:veteran.
At lower levels you can kill Irukandji but your focus should be on Tentacles. Tentacles alternate between slap and spin. You can just sidestep slap but spin has to be blocked/dodged. Animations are easy to recognize but dodge if unsure.
When Tentacles are killed, all Irukandjis disappear (except on level 50, where they only disappear once all the Colossi are dead), enemy=Jade_Maw:legendary wakes up, you get 10 seconds of agony and lots of Tentacles appear.
At level 50 people kill further Tentacle, gather up on front-left corner, kill aggroed Irukandji, prepare for agony (full health, healing/reviving skills ready) and then use ranged to kill final Tentacle.
Front-left area is a good spot to stay because you will be safe from Tentacles.
tactic=coordinated
Melee both tentacles. Coordinate the use of projectile defense at each tentacle (due to Irukandji), and interrupt/blind against each tentacle.
tactic=exploit
By sticking to left-side and jumping you can get behind all enemies and safely use ranged to destroy further Tentacle.
If no one can survive agony you can use 99% trick. One player gets defeated, people resurrect him up to 99%. Once agony hits everyone quickly gets him up, he won't get agony and can get other people up.

name=enemy=Jade_Maw:legendary
image=http://i.imgur.com/QuxhBdH.jpg
tactic=normal
Stick together. It is easy to get downed if you fail to absorb or evade Maws laser attack. It is also hard to revive people middle of Tentacles.
Maw will occasionally mark a target with a skull. When it disappears evade to avoid getting downed. To attack Maw, you need to hold a Crystal, absorb its laser attack and throw it back. Avoid using clones/minions because they get targeted and slow down the fight.
To get crystals, you have to kill enemy=Jade_Maw_Tentacles:veteran or enemy=Jade_Colossi:veteran. Colossi reflect projectiles and they can knockdown at melee-range (try to predict and dodge).
Unused Crystals will disappear after a while, you can grab and drop them to reset the timer.
Crystals can absorb unlimited amount of attacks so don't throw it away if you need to revive someone.
When you have killed all Colossi (keep an eye at the progress bar to prepare properly), the Maw becomes enemy=Enraged:legendary. Again you get 10 seconds of agony and Tentacles appear (this time they respawn though).
Now Maw will attack much more often which allows you to kill it faster.
When Maw is at ~10% all Tentacles will disappear and leave a Crystal. Maws final attack will hit entire area defeating any player who doesn't have a Crystal. Make sure you have a Crystal ready.
Don't leave after looting the first chest (unless you are certain you won't get daily chest). It takes some time but every day you will get one special chest at each tier.
tactic=coordinated
Melee everything by coordinating blocks, blinds, interrupts, and projectile defense (if at level 50).
tactic=coordinated|exploit
The Jade Maw can be life leeched. This can be accomplished via a sigil of leeching, vampiric aura (very slow), or via combining a dark field with projectile finishers. All of these methods can be combined.
tactic=guardian
Use blinds (wiki=Leap_of_Faith, wiki=Flashing_Blade, traited Virtue of Justice) or Aegis to protect team from Tentacles spin.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Wall_of_Reflection and/or wiki=Shield_of_the_Avenger to proect your team from the Irukandji's projectile attacks.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Mantra_of_Distraction to interrupt Tentacles spin.
tactic=necromancer
Use wiki=Doom to interrupt Tentacles spin.
tactic=necromancer
Use wells that are Dark fields in combination with projectile finishers to life leech the Jade Maw.
tactic=thief
Use Sword/Pistol in unorganized groups or on swap from Dagger/Pistol. wiki=Pistol_Whip allows you to evade laser. wiki=Shadow_Return can be used to quickly get Crystal. wiki=Black_Powder can keep enemies blinded.
tactic=thief
wiki=Shadow_Refuge is a Dark field, and can be used in combination with projectile finishers to life leech the Jade Maw.
tactic=elementalist
wiki=Lightning_Hammer blinds tentacles frequently enough to be completely invulnerable. Just remember that if you kill a tentacle during his attack he will remove all conditions and might kill you.
tactic=warrior
wiki=Defiant_Stance works against Maw's laser healing you to full health.
