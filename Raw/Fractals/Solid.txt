name=Instability
tactic=normal|31-40
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Lethargic|Lethargic: Reduces base endurance regeneration by 50%.
This shouldn't make a big difference because enemies don't deal that much damage. If you have trouble, take more wiki=Vigor or active defenses.
tactic=normal|41-50
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_No_Pain,_No_Gain|No_Pain,_No_Gain: Enemies receive wiki=Protection, 10 stacks of wiki=Might or 3 stacks of wiki=Stability when you hit them for critical damage (20 s cooldown).
Take some boon removal so you can remove applied boons every 20 secods.
tactic=normal|51-60
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Last_Laugh|Last_Laugh: Enemies explode when killed.
Dodge?
tactic=normal|61-70
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Sluggish|Sluggish: The recharge time of skills you use is increased if you have a condition on you.
You will pretty much always have a condition on you so your skills recharge slower all the time. This will mess up any rotations so to stay effective make sure you know which skills are important to use on cooldown.
tactic=normal|61-80
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Afflicted|Afflicted: Enemies apply random damaging conditions.
If you have trouble, take more condition removal.
tactic=normal|71-90
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Lethargic|Lethargic: Reduces base endurance regeneration by 50%.
Take more wiki=Vigor or active defenses so you can avoid all big hits.
tactic=normal|81-100
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Thieves|Boon_Thieves: Enemies steal 5 boons when they hit you (20 s cooldown).
Keep normal enemies disabled so they can't steal your boons. Don't use retaliation or you will get everyone killed. Avoid using swiftness to make bosses easier to handle. Be careful when using quickness or resistance.
tactic=normal|91-100
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Social_Awkwardness|Social_Awkwardness: Nearby allies receive agony when in combat.
Don't stack as a full group. 4 stacks of agony kills you in 25 seconds even with a max agony resist. If you don't have max agony resist stay away from everyone else.

name=Way to boss
tactic=normal
You will face enemy=Irukandjis:veteran, enemy=Giant_Irukandjis:veteran and enemy=Jade_Shards:veteran.
tactic=normal
| Sometimes killed at lower levels because of good loot.
tactic=normal|skip
Take one stun break to prevent nasty situations.
tactic=skip
If someone falls down he will teleport back downed. Monsters will very likely finish him/her so go help him/her up to prevent unnecessary delay.

name=Awakening
image=QuxhBdH.jpg
tactic=normal
To wake up Jade Maw you have to kill 2 enemy=Jade_Maw_Tentacles:veteran. Area is filled with respawning enemy=Irukandjis:veteran and enemy=Giant_Irukandjis:veteran.
At lower levels you can kill Irukandji but your focus should be on Tentacles. Tentacles alternate between slap and spin. You can just sidestep slap but spin has to be blocked/dodged. Animations are easy to recognize but dodge if unsure.
When Tentacles are killed, all Irukandjis disappear (except on level 50, where they only disappear once all the Colossi are dead), enemy=Jade_Maw:legendary wakes up, you get 10 seconds of agony and lots of Tentacles appear.
At level 50 people kill further Tentacle, gather up on front-left corner, kill aggroed Irukandji, prepare for agony (full health, healing/reviving skills ready) and then use ranged to kill final Tentacle.
Front-left area is a good spot to stay because you will be safe from Tentacles.
tactic=coordinated
Melee both tentacles. Coordinate the use of projectile defense at each tentacle (due to Irukandji), and interrupt/blind against each tentacle.
tactic=exploit
By sticking to left-side and jumping you can get behind all enemies and safely use ranged to destroy further Tentacle.
If no one can survive agony you can use 99% trick. One player gets defeated, people resurrect him up to 99%. Once agony hits everyone quickly gets him up, he won't get agony and can get other people up.

name=enemy=Jade_Maw:legendary
image=QuxhBdH.jpg
tactic=normal
Stick together. It is easy to get downed if you fail to absorb or evade Maws laser attack. It is also hard to revive people middle of Tentacles.
Maw will occasionally mark a target with a skull. When it disappears evade to avoid getting downed. To attack Maw, you need to hold a Crystal, absorb its laser attack and throw it back. Avoid using clones/minions because they get targeted and slow down the fight.
To get crystals, you have to kill enemy=Jade_Maw_Tentacles:veteran or enemy=Jade_Colossi:veteran. Colossi reflect projectiles and they can knockdown at melee-range (try to predict and dodge).
Unused Crystals will disappear after a while, you can grab and drop them to reset the timer.
Crystals can absorb unlimited amount of attacks so don't throw it away if you need to revive someone.
When you have killed all Colossi (keep an eye at the progress bar to prepare properly), the Maw becomes enemy=Enraged:legendary. Again you get 10 seconds of agony and Tentacles appear (this time they respawn though).
Now Maw will attack much more often which allows you to kill it faster.
When Maw is at ~10% all Tentacles will disappear and leave a Crystal. Maws final attack will hit entire area defeating any player who doesn't have a Crystal. Make sure you have a Crystal ready.
tactic=coordinated
Melee everything by coordinating blocks, blinds, interrupts, and projectile defense (if at level 50).
tactic=exploit
The Jade Maw can be life leeched. This can be accomplished via a sigil of leeching, vampiric aura (very slow), or via combining a dark field with projectile finishers. All of these methods can be combined.
tactic=guardian
Use blinds (wiki=Leap_of_Faith, wiki=Flashing_Blade, traited Virtue of Justice) or Aegis to protect team from Tentacles spin.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Wall_of_Reflection and/or wiki=Shield_of_the_Avenger to proect your team from the Irukandji's projectile attacks.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Mantra_of_Distraction to interrupt Tentacles spin.
tactic=necromancer
Use wiki=Doom to interrupt Tentacles spin.
tactic=necromancer
Use wells that are Dark fields in combination with projectile finishers to life leech the Jade Maw.
tactic=thief
Use Sword/Pistol in unorganized groups or on swap from Dagger/Pistol. wiki=Pistol_Whip allows you to evade laser. wiki=Shadow_Return can be used to quickly get Crystal. wiki=Black_Powder can keep enemies blinded.
tactic=thief
wiki=Shadow_Refuge is a Dark field, and can be used in combination with projectile finishers to life leech the Jade Maw.
tactic=elementalist
wiki=Lightning_Hammer blinds tentacles frequently enough to be completely invulnerable. Just remember that if you kill a tentacle during his attack he will remove all conditions and might kill you.
tactic=warrior
wiki=Defiant_Stance works against Maw's laser healing you to full health.
