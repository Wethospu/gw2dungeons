wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Lethargic|Lethargic: Reduces base endurance regeneration by 50%.
This shouldn't make a big difference because enemies don't deal that much damage. If you have trouble, take more wiki=Vigor or active defenses.
tactic=normal|41-50
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_No_Pain,_No_Gain|No_Pain,_No_Gain: Enemies receive wiki=Protection, 10 stacks of wiki=Might or 3 stacks of wiki=Stability when you hit them for critical damage (20 s cooldown).
Take some boon removal so you can remove applied boons every 20 secods.
tactic=normal|51-60
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Last_Laugh|Last_Laugh: Enemies explode when killed.
Dodge?
tactic=normal|61-70
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Sluggish|Sluggish: The recharge time of skills you use is increased if you have a condition on you.
You will pretty much always have a condition on you so your skills recharge slower all the time. This will mess up any rotations so to stay effective make sure you know which skills are important to use on cooldown.
tactic=normal|61-80
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Afflicted|Afflicted: Enemies apply random damaging conditions.
If you have trouble, take more condition removal.

tactic=normal|81-100
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Thieves|Boon_Thieves: Enemies steal 5 boons when they hit you (20 s cooldown).
Keep normal enemies disabled so they can't steal your boons. Don't use retaliation or you will get everyone killed. Avoid using swiftness to make bosses easier to handle. Be careful when using quickness or resistance.
tactic=normal|91-100
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Social_Awkwardness|Social_Awkwardness: Nearby allies receive agony when in combat.
Don't stack as a full group. 4 stacks of agony kills you in 25 seconds even with a max agony resist. If you don't have max agony resist stay away from everyone else.

name=Start
tactic=normal
The starting area is like a maze with walls separating different sections. There are 10 passages which allow you move between different sections. However passages open and close randomly every 50 seconds. At all times 3 passages are closed so you are able to move quite freely. Also there are multiple spots where you can just jump over the wall. Learning these spots is important so you don't have to rely on luck. 
To make things worse, the area is filled with enemies, neutral animals and traps. All enemies respawn do don't bother attacking them. There are 3 types of traps which cause either cripple, immobilize or knock down. Traps can be difficult to see unless you know what you are looking for. There are also 2 spots which cause enemy=Mossman_(Stalk) to appear for 20 seconds. He is quite harmless as long as you keep some distance.
This all can be bit overwhelming for a new player so observe the area carefully before you make any moves. It's easy to get killed if you constantly trigger traps when being chased by multiple enemies. All traps can be jumped over so the simplest way to move around is to keep jumping. You may still hit some traps so take stunbreaks and condition removal.
Go to the marked spot on the map to release 3 wisps. They will get randomly put to 6 pre-defined locations on the area. Your goal is to bring all 3 wisps back to nearby tree stumps before the timer runs out. The timer starts after someone grabs a wisp so you don't have to panic. The event resets if the timer runs out or someone drops his wisp on purpose. This puts all wisps to rerolled starting locations. Dropping a wisp on purpose can be used to roll better starting locations if you have problems.
When carrying a wisp, your weapon skills disappear and some passages will always close when you get near (scales with level). To counter this, you can jump over walls at many points (only way to reliably do it). Remember to drop off from walls instead of jumping to prevent getting in combat.

name=Running the wisps
Determine which 3 players run the wisps. This is usually done by just running towards a wisp. Don't be surprised if everyone else just stands still because lots of people are either insecure about their running skills or just lazy. Remind them about the objective if needed. It's recommended to practice wisp running whenever you can because it gets much harder on higher scales. Start with closer wisps and then on harder one when you get more experienced.
Take mobility, condition removal, healing and stun breaks if you are going to run a wisp. You will lose your weapon skills when grabbing a wisp so the weapon can only be used for prebuffing swiftness and other boons. Don't swap weapons, drop bundles, use any transformations or get downed so you don't lose your wisp.
Don't take your wisp until other runners are near their wisps to give them more time. Keep an eye on the timer in case someone starts it early. This usually happens on lower scales because there is so much extra time. On higher scales you have much less time so ask that everyone is ready and then say "go". It's recommended to let the player who has the farthest wisp to start the timer so he has bit more time.
Remaining 2 players should be polite and assist runners if needed. This is done by removing their conditions, giving them boons and even pulling enemies away. Assisting isn't usually done because people are lazy and also because it's not needed if the runners are experienced. When playing with random people it's recommended to stand near middle so you can quickly move in if it looks a like a runner needs help. Of course if people fail then you should assist them the whole time.
tactic=warrior
Use wiki=Charge_(warrior_skill)|Charge right before taking a wisp for swiftness. Don't use wiki=Call_to_Arms because you may hit something and enter combat.
Take wiki=Mending, wiki=Balanced_Stance, wiki="Shake_It_Off", wiki=Bull's_Charge and wiki=Signet_of_Rage for mobility, condition removal and stun breaks.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Portal_Entre for a group wide mobility.
Use wiki=Mantra_of_Resolve or wiki=Mantra_of_Recovery (if Mender's Purity-trait) to remove conditions.
Use wiki=Mantra_of_Concentration for stability and stun breaks.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki="Stand_Your_Ground!", wiki="Save_Yourselves!" and wiki="Retreat!" with Pure of Voice-trait or Soldier-runes for swiftness, stun breaks and condition removal.
Use wiki=Judge's_Intervention on a critter (to not get in combat) when running a Wisp.
tactic=necromancer
Use wiki=Spectral_Walk / wiki=Summon_Flesh_Wurm to skip most of the obstacles.
Use wiki=Well_of_Power (works on caster even when not standing inside) and wiki=Consume_Conditions to clear conditions.
tactic=thief
Use wiki=Shadowstep and wiki=Steal on a critter (to not get in combat) when running a Wisp.
Set a wiki=Shadow_Trap and use it to teleport back after grabbing the wisp.
tactic=engineer
Use wiki=Super_Speed and wiki=Rocket_Boots for mobility.
tactic=north-west
media=swamp_1.jpg|Map. The wisp is guarded by enemy=Skelks:normal. Stand on any nearby rock while waiting so they can't reach you. You should jump over trees because otherwise you may have to run a very long way which won't work on higher scales.
Practice the first jump couple of times (tell your team wait a bit if needed). Don't jump down so you don't enter combat. After the jump just run forward and pay attention to the ground as there are multiple traps. If the next passage is open just go through. If not, stay calm and jump over. Don't try to run around because other nearby passages will just close before you.
tactic=north
media=swamp_2.jpg|Map. Once you pick the wisp you get attacked by 20 enemy=Marsh_Mosquitos:normal. They won't deal much damage but if they hit you will get in combat which slows you down.
If the closest passage is closed you should jump over it. Practice couple of times if needed. Alternatively you can ask your team to wait (keep in mind that passages change every 50 seconds). Mossman will probably spawn after the passage. If he does and the next one is closed you should run around (either way is fine) unless you have practiced the jump. After the second passage either turn right or jump over the wall (passages will close).
Alternatively you can immediately turn to right and just follow same way as with media=swamp_1.jpg|the_north-west_wisp.
tactic=north-east
media=swamp_3.jpg|Map. Be careful when approaching the wisp as there are multiple traps on the ground. Once you pick it up, binding roots will appear on you every 6 seconds. Keep moving at all times to not get caught (especially during jumps). If you get hit you get will constantly immobilized and may have to use multiple condition removals to get out (you can't attack roots with the wisp).
The closest passage will close when you get near (practice jumping). Alternatively you can just turn right and use the next passage. After that just run forward. If that passage is closed turn right to jump over the wall near the next passage.
tactic=west
media=swamp_4.jpg|Map. Be careful when approaching the wisp as there are multiple traps on the ground. There is one trap directly beneath the wisp. Wait few seconds for it to go off if needed. Be ready to remove conditions if you get hit.
Just run south and jump over the wall if needed (plenty of time so no rush).
tactic=east
media=swamp_5.jpg|Map. The wisp is guarded by a enemy=Marsh_Drake:champion so either stay back or run to a rock at back wall. Once you grab the wisp, about 12 enemy=Marsh_Drake_Hatchlings:normal appear. Just ignore them and keep moving. If the passage is closed then just keep going and jump over the wall near the next passage.
tactic=south-east
media=swamp_6.jpg|Map. Be careful when approaching the wisp as there are multiple spider eggs on the ground. When touched they break and 2-3 enemy=Spider_Hatchlings:normal appear. If you break lots of them you will get killed. You can safely get through if you jump on rocks. You can also wait bit further way and rush in once the countdown starts.
Once you grab the wisp, 7 enemy=Marsh_Spiders:normal appear. Just ignore them and keep moving. It doesn't really matter if you break eggs at this point (but you can jump on the rocks!). If both the first and the second passage are closed then just keep going and jump over the wall near the next passage.

path=SwampMoss
name=enemy=The_Mossman:legendary
tactic=normal
He aggros immediately when you land from the water. If you get back and try to attack him in the water invulnerable enemy=Skelk:normal appear. However, if you pull him far enough out in the water tunnel, the skelk will not be there.
Mossman is a very dangerous enemy because of his stealth and high damage attacks. The most important thing is to remember to rally from enemy=Wolves:normal.
His normal melee attack does lots of damage and has high range. The high range causes him to often kill unaware secondary targets. Keep him crippled and/or chilled and kite at least at max melee range to prevent him from using it.
His ranged attack bounces few times and causes agony (you may get double agony). If you get hit you can easily get other people killed so do what you can to counter it (block, dodge, anti projectile skills).
Once in a while he stealths which makes his attacks hard to avoid because you can't see him or his animations. Keep looking at mini-map to get some idea about his location. He also summons a Wolf.
In a less coordinated group, the most important thing is to not kill the Wolf. There's a high chance that someone will become downed, and that Wolf could be used to rally off of. Everyone should tag Wolves with low damage attacks if possible (don't kill it). In a more coordinated group that is relying on Aegis or other blocks to mitigate some of Mossman's attacks, you should seek to kill wolves quickly, so they do not eat blocks.
There are two ways to end his stealth. Wait until it expires or get hit. If you keep kiting and waiting until it expires he will spend lots of time stealthed. It's safer but makes the fight last longer.
If you can afford it get hit. Mossman always attempts to focus one target (the person he is following and trying to melee). If he is following you, tag the Wolf, stand still and let him hit you. Even if you get downed you can kill the Wolf to rally. Pets/clones can also be used to do this to some extent.
After 75% he will start to throw his axe which also inflicts agony. Then he will spawn 2 Wolves, start chasing his primary target, teleport to him when close enough and do his lethal dual melee attack. The Melee attack again has huge range, so dodge away from him to avoid him from turning and potentially killing other players.
He literally won't do any other attacks when chasing his target, which allows other players to attack him freely. However after ~10 seconds he will stealth which makes it much harder to avoid his lethal attack. Also it will cause him to be stealthed pretty much all the time because he still has his normal stealth.
After 25% he may transform (rare) to different enemy=animal_forms:legendary with very dangerous leaps and melee attacks. He won't stealth or use ranged attacks though.
tactic=coordinated
Stack might and stealth before getting aggro, and then fight directly on top of Mossman. Chain anti-projectile skills and CC, make use of Aegis if you have it, and stay behind Mossman unless he is aggroed on you. In a coordinated group, Mossman's aggro can be manipulated by a combination of first hit and higher toughness than the rest of the group; it's ideal to let a Guardian or an Earth Elemental take the aggro.
tactic=exploit
Mossman has a maximum number of wolves that he can spawn, and the wolves have a limited aggro radius. As such, it is possible to spawn out all of the wolves on one side of the arena, die, and then fight Mossman on the other side of the arena without any wolves being spawned. Because it takes a lot of time to spawn the wolves, this method is only helpful if you are looking for a speed kill (timed from first hit until death), or don't think you can defeat Mossman along with the adds he spawns.
tactic=bug
Sometimes, Mossman's stealth does not expire based on its time limit as it should, and you must take a hit in order to have it expire. This can be extremely problematic in solo/duo situations.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Wall_of_Reflection and wiki=Shield_of_the_Avenger to negate agony projectile. Use wiki="Retreat!" and Virtue of Courage to keep Aegis up.

tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Feedback and wiki=Temporal_Curtain (traited) to reflect projectiles.

path=SwampBloom
name=enemy=Bloomhunger:legendary
tactic=normal
Much easier than Mossman. All attacks can be easily avoided. He summons spirits but you usually don't have to care about them. If retaliation causes too much damage then kill enemy=Storm_Spirit:normal.
His normal attack shoots 3 projectiles. Each will leave a poison cloud unless blocked or absorbed/reflected by an antiprojectile skill. Poison clouds quickly stack up at melee-range so prevent them from appearing.
When he smashes ground he will shoot 6 projectiles around him. They deal high damage and cause Binding Roots (attack to destroy). Melee players can stay inside Bloomhunger and they won't get hit.
His most dangerous attack is when he shakes leaves and shoots multiple ballistic projectiles. Landing spots get marked with red rings so stay out of them and dodge if needed. Each hit deals high damage and agony.
tactic=coordinated
Chain anti-projectile skills and assign a player to kill the Storm Spirit as soon as it spawns.
