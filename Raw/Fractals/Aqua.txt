Enemies: Krait and fish.

Use Oils or wiki=Skale_Venom_(consumable)|Skale_Venom, wiki=Superior_Sigil_of_Force|Sigil_of_Force and wiki=Superior_Sigil_of_Frailty|Sigil_of_Frailty.
Remember that your wiki=Agony_Resistance will drop up to 15 points from a lack of helmet or land weapons.

Against the krait, use wiki=Powerful_Potion_of_Krait_Slaying|Potion_of_Krait_Slaying or wiki=Powerful_Potion_of_Slaying_Scarlet's_Armies and wiki=Superior_Sigil_of_Serpent_Slaying|Sigil_Of_Serpent_Slaying.

name=Instability
tactic=normal|31-40
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Fumbler|Boon_Fumbler: When you dodge roll, you lose all your boons.
Losing both might and fury is a big damage loss so rely on other active defense. Enemies won't hit hard so take bit more sustain and tank attacks instead of dodging.
Don't dodge when running around so you don't lose swiftness.
tactic=normal|41-50
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_No_Pain,_No_Gain|No_Pain,_No_Gain: Enemies recieve random boons when you hit them for critical damage.
Possible boons are aegis, fury, might, protection, regeneration, retaliation and stability.
If eveyone has a high critical chance your party will generate a huge amount of boons. Boon removal can help but the gain is questionable if you sacrifice lots of damage.
Control skills are not effective because enemies will have stability. Condition damage is more effective because enemies will have protection. Take more sustain to counter damage from retaliation.
Bosses can't deal critical hits so fury has no effect. Bosses have a high power and a low healing power so might and regeneration don't have a big effect.
tactic=normal|51-60
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Last_Laugh|Last_Laugh: Enemies explode when killed.
Dodge?
tactic=normal|61-70
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Sluggish|Sluggish: The recharge time of skills you use is increased if you have a condition on you.
You will pretty much always have a condition on you so your skills recharge slower all the time. This will mess up any rotations so to stay effective make sure you know which skills are important to use on cooldown.
tactic=normal|61-80
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Afflicted|Afflicted: Enemies apply random conditions.
Be prepated to get immobilized or feared, especially when fighting enemy groups. Use stability if needed.
tactic=normal|71-90
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Fumbler|Boon_Fumbler: When you dodge roll, you lose all your boons.
Losing both might and fury is a big damage loss so rely on other active defense. Consider taking bit more sustain and tank weaker attacks instead of dodging.
Don't dodge when running around so you don't lose swiftness.
tactic=normal|81-100
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Thieves|Boon_Thieves: Enemies steal boons when they hit you.
Don't use retaliation or you will get everyone killed. Avoid using swiftness to make bosses easier to handle. Be careful with using quickness or resistance.
tactic=normal|91-100
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Social_Awkwardness|Social_Awkwardness: Nearby allies receive agony.
Don't stack as a full group. 4 stacks of agony kills you in 25 seconds even with a max agony resist. If you don't have max agony resist stay away from everyone else.

name=Save the villagers
tactic=normal
You need to kill 3 groups of Krait and interact with cages to rescue enemy=villagers.
Stack behind a statue to corner the krait and give you a wall for rush-type abilities.
The first group has a enemy=Damoss:veteran and 4 enemy=Damosses:normal. The second group has a enemy=Damoss:normal, 2 enemy=Nimrosses:normal and 2 enemy=Hypnosses:normal with their dangerous poison-cloud attack. The last group has 2 enemy=Damosses:veteran and 2 enemy=Nimrosses:veteran.
After the villagers are saved, the path will split and you will either have to go through Darkness or survive as a Dolphin.
tactic=warrior
Use wiki=Tsunami_Slash into a statue to deal high damage.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Vortex to pull Krait together and wiki=Feigned_Surge into a statue to deal high damage.
tactic=elementalist
Use wiki=Tidal_Wave into a statue to deal high damage.

path=AquaDark
name=Darkness
tactic=normal
Staying in darkness quickly kills you. Carry a link=http://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/0/01/Luminous_Plant.jpg|Luminous_Plant to protect you and nearby players.
The plant doesn't last very long so start moving once you pick it up. You can drop a plant early to pick up a new one and refresh your timer.
Once someone reaches Jellyfish Beast you get a new checkpoint so you can just die if you can't get through.
tactic=skip
After the descent take a left between the stalactites and stalagmites and cross through the center of the room.
Have one person run through solo and the rest of the party res at the checkpoint.

path=AquaDolphin
name=Dolphin
tactic=normal
Unequip your all armor (including Breather) to prevent repair costs. Armor has no effect and you die pretty easily. Buffs will stay after transformation so stack swiftness and aegis before starting.
The area is filled with Krait (most hidden) which can easily kill a lone Dolphin. Surviving is easier if you go as a group (wait for slower people when possible).
Your first skill scans the area and reveals hidden Krait so spam it as much as possible.
Your second skill summons a clone which you should use to distract Krait (use the skill again to make your clone stop and start "distracting").
Your third skill gives you a slight speed boost but it isn't that useful.
Your fourth skill resurrects all nearby players which is extremely strong when in a group. Use it as soon as someone dies.
Use your dodges wisely. You need to dodge twice to prevent sink from the Krait.
Once someone reaches Jellyfish Beast you get a new checkpoint so you can just die if you can't get through, but don't ressurect before you get the checkpoint or your party will have to wait for you to die again.
tactic=coordinated
Stack swiftness and aegis before entering. Hug the bottom right through the whole run. Stick together and ressurect whenever someone goes down.
tactic=normal|coordinated
tactic=warrior
Use a banner so all your party members can use wiki=Inspire.

path=AquaDark|AquaDolphin
name=enemy=Jellyfish_Beast:legendary
tactic=ranged
Stay at range at all times to avoid Beast's melee attacks, especially his agony attack. Keep up swiftness if you can for a better mobility and dodge away from him if he gets close.
Try to pull Beast to electrified cages and break his defiance there for a decent damage. Keep moving at all times to avoid attacks from summoned enemy=Jellyfishes.
tactic=melee
Learn his animations so you can dodge away when he starts spinning. If you get hit you get constantly stunned which makes you an easy target for summoned enemy=Jellyfishes. Consider taking stability when practising.
His basic Slash attack deals lots of damage and knocks you away. It can be avoided by sidestepping but dodge when uncertain.
tactic=coordinated
Go full melee to maximise your damage and ignore cages. Try to cleave summoned enemy=Jellyfishes to kill them before more appear. Use area stability or self stability to counter his spinning.
Keep his defiance below 50% at all times. Don't push it too low or it might break from conditions. Break the defiance when he uses Swallow to prevent the brief damage resistance.
tactic=warrior
Use wiki=Balanced_Stance to attack him during electric spin when meleeing.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki="Stand_Your_Ground!" to protect your team from electric spin.
Use Aegis against Slash melee attack.
tactic=necromancer
Being in wiki=Death_Shroud completely counters his Swallow attack. You will get out of the shroud instead of being eaten.
Remember to corrupt his 25 might stacks after people get Swallowed.
tactic=mesmer
If you expect people to constantly get Swallowed, use wiki=Arcane_Thievery to steal 25 might and wiki=Signet_of_Inspiration to give them to your team.
tactic=ranger
Use your pets to tank Beast if your party is using ranged attacks. This often keeps him in place which simplifies the fight.
