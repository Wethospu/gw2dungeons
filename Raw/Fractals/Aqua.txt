name=Instability
tactic=normal|31-40
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Fumbler|Boon_Fumbler: When you dodge roll, you lose all your boons.
Losing both might and fury is a big damage loss so rely on other active defense. Enemies won't hit hard so take bit more sustain and tank attacks instead of dodging.
Don't dodge when running around so you don't lose swiftness.
tactic=normal|41-50
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_No_Pain,_No_Gain|No_Pain,_No_Gain: Enemies recieve random boons when you hit them for critical damage.
Possible boons are aegis, fury, might, protection, regeneration, retaliation and stability.
If eveyone has a high critical chance your party will generate a huge amount of boons. Boon removal can help but the gain is questionable if you sacrifice lots of damage.
Control skills are not effective because enemies will have stability. Condition damage is more effective because enemies will have protection. Take more sustain to counter damage from retaliation.
Bosses can't deal critical hits so fury has no effect. Bosses have a high power and a low healing power so might and regeneration don't have a big effect.
tactic=normal|51-60
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Last_Laugh|Last_Laugh: Enemies explode when killed.
Dodge?
tactic=normal|61-70
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Sluggish|Sluggish: The recharge time of skills you use is increased if you have a condition on you.
You will pretty much always have a condition on you so your skills recharge slower all the time. This will mess up any rotations so to stay effective make sure you know which skills are important to use on cooldown.
tactic=normal|61-80
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Afflicted|Afflicted: Enemies apply random conditions.
Be prepated to get immobilized or feared, especially when fighting enemy groups. Use stability if needed.
tactic=normal|71-90
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Fumbler|Boon_Fumbler: When you dodge roll, you lose all your boons.
Losing both might and fury is a big damage loss so rely on other active defense. Consider taking bit more sustain and tank weaker attacks instead of dodging.
Don't dodge when running around so you don't lose swiftness.
tactic=normal|81-100
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Thieves|Boon_Thieves: Enemies steal boons when they hit you.
Don't use retaliation or you will get everyone killed. Avoid using swiftness to make bosses easier to handle. Be careful with using quickness or resistance.
tactic=normal|91-100
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Social_Awkwardness|Social_Awkwardness: Nearby allies receive agony.
Don't stack as a full group. 4 stacks of agony kills you in 25 seconds even with a max agony resist. If you don't have max agony resist stay away from everyone else.

name=Save the villagers
tactic=normal
You need to kill 3 groups of Krait and interact with cages to rescue enemy=villagers.
Stack behind a statue to corner the krait and give you a wall for rush-type abilities.
The first group has a enemy=Damoss:veteran and 4 enemy=Damosses:normal. The second group has a enemy=Damoss:normal, 2 enemy=Nimrosses:normal and 2 enemy=Hypnosses:normal with their dangerous poison-cloud attack. The last group has 2 enemy=Damosses:veteran and 2 enemy=Nimrosses:veteran.
After the villagers are saved, the path will split and you will either have to go through Darkness or survive as a Dolphin.
tactic=warrior
Use wiki=Tsunami_Slash into a statue to deal high damage.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Vortex to pull Krait together and wiki=Feigned_Surge into a statue to deal high damage.
tactic=elementalist
Use wiki=Tidal_Wave into a statue to deal high damage.

path=AquaDark
name=Darkness
tactic=normal
Staying in darkness quickly kills you. Carry a link=http://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/0/01/Luminous_Plant.jpg|Luminous_Plant to protect you and nearby players.
The plant doesn't last very long so start moving once you pick it up. You can drop a plant early to pick up a new one and refresh your timer.
Once someone reaches Jellyfish Beast you get a new checkpoint so you can just die if you can't get through.
tactic=skip
After the descent take a left between the stalactites and stalagmites and cross through the center of the room.
Have one person run through solo and the rest of the party res at the checkpoint.

path=AquaDolphin
name=Dolphin
tactic=normal
Unequip your all armor (including Breather) to prevent repair costs. Armor has no effect and you die pretty easily. Buffs will stay after transformation so stack swiftness and aegis before starting.
The area is filled with Krait (most hidden) which can easily kill a lone Dolphin. Surviving is easier if you go as a group (wait for slower people when possible).
Your first skill scans the area and reveals hidden Krait so spam it as much as possible.
Your second skill summons a clone which you should use to distract Krait (use the skill again to make your clone stop and start "distracting").
Your third skill gives you a slight speed boost but it isn't that useful.
Your fourth skill resurrects all nearby players which is extremely strong when in a group. Use it as soon as someone dies.
Use your dodges wisely. You need to dodge twice to prevent sink from the Krait.
Once someone reaches Jellyfish Beast you get a new checkpoint so you can just die if you can't get through, but don't ressurect before you get the checkpoint or your party will have to wait for you to die again.
tactic=coordinated
Stack swiftness and aegis before entering. Hug the bottom right through the whole run. Stick together and ressurect whenever someone goes down.
tactic=normal|coordinated
tactic=warrior
Use a banner so all your party members can use wiki=Inspire.

path=AquaDark|AquaDolphin
name=enemy=Jellyfish_Beast:legendary
tactic=bug
Swallow attack removes all agony resist while you are inside him. This means its agony will cause much higher damage or even instantly defeat players at higher scales. You may have (needs verification) to re-equip your gear to get agony resist back which can't be done when in combat.
tactic=ranged
Stay at range at all times to avoid Beast's melee attacks, especially his agony attack. Keep up swiftness if you can for a better mobility and dodge away from him if he gets close.
Try to pull Beast to electrified cages and break his defiance there for a decent damage. Keep moving at all times to avoid attacks from summoned enemy=Jellyfishes.
tactic=melee
Melee is not recommended without support from your party. His Swallow attack is bugged and removes your agony resist which means you will get instantly defeated on higher scales. The attack can only be avoided by breaking his defiance which is tricky to do alone. Also if he focuses you won't get the damage from electrified cages.
Learn his animations so you can dodge away when he starts spinning. If you get hit you get constantly stunned which makes you an easy target for summoned enemy=Jellyfishes. Consider taking stability when practising.
His basic Slash attack deals lots of damage and knocks you away. It can be avoided by sidestepping but dodge when uncertain.
tactic=coordinated
Go full melee to maximise your damage and ignore cages. Try to cleave summoned enemy=Jellyfishes to kill them before more appear. Use area stability or self stability to counter his spinning.
Keep his defiance below 50% at all times. Don't push it too low or it might break from conditions. Break the defiance when he uses Swallow to prevent someone getting killed.
tactic=exploit
There are multiple different tactics. You should verify which one your party is planning to use.
All exploits rely on two mechanics. The first is that your character gets teleported to the boss area entrance if you go to character selection screen and then back to the game. This is often referred as "relogging". The second is that you can retry the fight without Beast resetting if you are able to attack him fast enough.
The most effective tactic is graveyard rushing. Idea is to go melee and maximise your damage. When there are only 1-2 players alive they pull Beast to the area entrance. Once they get defeated, everyone immediately respawns and someone uses a ranged attack to aggro Beast again. Beast won't regain any health if done properly which means you will be able to eventually kill him.
There is also a less coordinated tactic. You can simply get out of combat during the fight by moving away from Beast fast enough. This is much easier to do when Beast is aggroed to someone else. So when there are only 2 players left they should split up. When one of the player gets out of combat he should immediately move back and be ready to attack Beast when the other player gets killed. This is still bit unreliable because summoned enemy=Jellyfishes may follow you. If this happens burst them down.
Tactics relying on "relogging" are less efficient because you often have to manually resurrect players. But if you switch to a character who hasn't been killed yet, they will appear at the area entrance with full health. If you have multiple characters available you can use this even when your party is using a different tactic.
Resurrecting "relogged" characters can be done in two ways. You can either permanently have one player waiting at the entrance or just go resurrect when needed. The former is slower because you have to 4-man the fight but safer. If players move to resurrect it's possible that enemies follow you which complicates the situation.
Keep in mind that resurrecting a player when in out of combat takes up to 20 seconds. When in combat the time is doubled. The time can be reduced with quickness and increased revive speed.
tactic=warrior
Use wiki=Balanced_Stance to attack him during electric spin when meleeing.
When using the "relog"-exploit, you should stay at the entrance if needed. With wiki=Determined_Revival and wiki=Frenzy you can resurrect people faster. You can also help the party by using wiki=Banner_of_Strength and wiki=Banner_of_Discipline with wiki=Inspiring_Battle_Standard.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki="Stand_Your_Ground!" to protect your team from electric spin.
Use Aegis against Slash melee attack.
tactic=necromancer
Being in wiki=Death_Shroud completely counters his Swallow attack. You will get out of the shroud instead of being eaten. As long as everyone else stays at range you will get Swallowed every time which simplifies the fight, especially if Beast stays aggroed on you. Your party can melee for up to 15 seconds after Swallow is used because it has a cooldown of 20 seconds.
Remember to corrupt his 25 might stacks after people get Swallowed.
tactic=mesmer
If you expect people to constantly get Swallowed, use wiki=Arcane_Thievery to steal 25 might and wiki=Signet_of_Inspiration to give them to your team.
tactic=ranger
Use your pets to tank Beast if your party is using ranged attacks. This often keeps him in place which simplifies the fight.
