wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Sluggish|Sluggish: The recharge time of skills you use is increased if you have a condition on you.
You will pretty much always have a condition on you so your skills recharge slower all the time. This will mess up any rotations so to stay effective make sure you know which skills are important to use on cooldown.

wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Thieves|Boon_Thieves: Enemies steal 5 boons when they hit you (20 s cooldown).
Keep normal enemies disabled so they can't steal your boons. Don't use retaliation or you will get everyone killed. Avoid using swiftness to make bosses easier to handle. Be careful when using quickness or resistance.
tactic=normal|91-100
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Social_Awkwardness|Social_Awkwardness: Nearby allies receive agony when in combat.
Don't stack as a full group. 4 stacks of agony kills you in 25 seconds even with a max agony resist. If you don't have max agony resist stay away from everyone else.

name=Start
tactic=normal|skip
As soon as you spawn you start getting stacks of Frostbite. It deals some damage every second per stack and becomes quite deadly at a high number of stacks. Staying near a heat source removes all stacks and grants a short immunity against being inflicted with additional Frostbite stacks.
tactic=normal
Run along the road and use wiki=Stab_(Rusty_Old_Torch) to lit up bonfires. Be careful to not fall down.
tactic=skip
The safest way to get down fast is to follow the road to right and then fall down when it turns left.
The fastest way to get down is to just move forward from the beginning and get down using a structure made of wooden planks. It takes some practice so you should practice it alone.
tactic=optional
To complete the achievement "If We Only Had Marshmallows" remember to lit up every bonfire.

name=Ice Wall
tactic=normal|skip
At the bottom there are 6 bonfires next to each other which you have to keep lit to melt the nearby ice wall. Fires only stay up for 10 seconds and you need to light them up 4 times (if done normally) to melt the wall. As soon as you get there 2 enemy=Sons_of_Svanir_(Axe):veteran and 4 enemy=Sons_of_Svanir_(Greatsword):veteran start respawning.
tactic=normal
At lower levels (see Skip for harder levels) you can simply keep killing enemies while keeping the fires up. Once the wall melts, kill remaining enemies and proceed. Enemies will keep respawning so don't stay there too long.
tactic=normal|skip
Camp fires will remove Frostbite when you enter their range even when not lit. You can use this to get out of combat to allow people respawn or to change skills and traits. Keep in mind that the immunity won't automatically reapply in the area so if you want to stay there longer you have to manually re-enter the area. Don't get too close so you don't aggro enemies.
Keep this in mind while fighting enemy=Elemental_Source:structure if you are getting overrun by enemy=Ice_Elementals:veteran.
tactic=coordinated
1-2 players can keep the enemies busy while rest of the team spams wiki=Stab_(Rusty_Old_Torch) on the bonfires. Repeatedly stabbing the fires speeds up progress, as does having high might when stabbing the fires (pre-stack before you start stabbing them), as does quickness.
Alternatively a thief can stealth the entire team, although this is generally slower than the above method.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Line_of_Warding at front of enemies when they spawn. Tag them with Staff. Use wiki=Ring_of_Warding and wiki=Zealot's_Embrace and keep kiting them while others keep fire up.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Wall_of_Reflection to protect team.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Feedback to protect your team.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Temporal_Curtain and wiki=Illusionary_Wave to control enemies.
tactic=necromancer
Use wiki=Spectral_Wall, wiki=Well_of_Darkness, wiki=Plague and wiki=Reaper's_Mark to control and blind enemies.
tactic=necromancer
Use wiki=Grasping_Dead, wiki=Unholy_Feast, wiki=Chilblains and/or wiki=Tainted_Shackles to slow down enemies.
tactic=skip
The easiest way is to use hit and run tactic. Go in with defensive skills, light up fires and run far away so the enemies stop following. Other people can help and pull enemies away first. Once the wall melts just leave dead players behind and proceed until enemies stop following. When they stop following you should run back to the bonfires.
tactic=warrior
Use wiki=Defiant_Stance and wiki=Endure_Pain to tank hits while litting up fires.
tactic=warrior
Use wiki="Fear_Me!" for long control to protect you and your team.
tactic=thief
Use wiki=Smoke_Screen with wiki=Cluster_Bomb and wiki=Shadow_Refuge to easily solo it while stealthed.

name=enemy=Elemental_Source:structure
tactic=normal
Stick together and try to stay near the entrance. There will be lots of pressure so you need to support each other and revive people fast. Consider marking the spot on the minimap. Keep in mind that Source won't reset so you can at any time run back to the previous area with bonfires or even wipe.
There are 5 bonfires scattered around the area which stay lit for 10 seconds. On top of helping with Frostbite they also draw aggro from Source. Try to keep one lit at all times.
The Source won't deal much damage on its own. Its basic projectile attack launches while its area attack cripples and launches at the end. The Source can stunlock you for a while so take at least one stun break or better yet bring party-wide stability.
At 75%, 50% and 25% health the Source will cause a snowstorm which reduces visibility, teleports ~2 players away and summons 5 enemy=Ice_Elementals:veteran around the area. This is the hardest part of the fight so ensure you have no Frostbite before it happens.
The most important thing is to avoid aggroing every Ice Elemental. Look at your position on the minimap, move on sides of the area and meet near the entrance. Focus on surviving and stick together until the snowstorm ends. Try to light up the fire as soon as possible although you can survive the whole duration without it under optimal conditions.
Once the situation is clear you should focus down Ice Elementals. You can run back to the tent to pull them closer, or you can group them using Binding Blades or Into The Void. They hit quite hard so stay out of red circles and dodge their all attacks. Anti projectile skills are useful against their basic projectile attack.
When Source dies the blizzard ends and you no longer gain Frostbite stacks. However current stacks won't disappear so remember to visit a bonfire before proceeding.
tactic=coordinated
Coordinated groups have two different strategies which can be employed.
The first strategy is to suicide rush the first 50% of the source, stacking might before going in, and after the snowstorm continuing to kill the source. After everyone wipes (after the second snowstorm), the party repeats this strategy.
The second strategy is to do things as per the normal strategy for the first 50%, and then go all-in for the last 50% (the same as is done in the first strategy).
tactic=exploit
A Necromancer can use Epidemic to inflict the swirler with conditions, and eventually kill it. This may not be an exploit; the hitbox for the source was shifted (along with every other structure hitbox in the entire game, to some degree) in a patch. Prior to this patch, the source could be killed in many different ways, which may have been an exploit or may have been intended.
Blind works against Elemental Source which helps avoiding its attacks.
tactic=optional
To complete the achievement "If We Only Had Marshmallows" remember to lit up every bonfire after Source is destroyed.
tactic=mesmer
Use Focus with wiki=Warden's_Feedback. Use wiki=Temporal_Curtain to pull Elementals together or as a projectile reflection.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Binding_Blade to pull Elementals together. Use wiki=Wall_of_Reflection against their basic attack.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki="Stand_Your_Ground!" and wiki=Hallowed_Ground to protect team from Sources attacks.
tactic=necromancer
wiki=Lich_Form is really good to destroy Elementals fast.
tactic=necromancer
Use wiki=Spectral_Walk right before getting teleported to get instantly back.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Portal right before getting teleported to get instantly back.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Mantra_of_Concentration to prevent control (especially useful when reviving).
tactic=thief
Use wiki=Smoke_Screen to block projectiles and also to blind other attacks.
tactic=elementalist
wiki=Firestorm and wiki=Ice_Storm do massive damage to Source.
tactic=warrior
wiki=Healing_Signet is very useful to counter Frostbite.

name=Forest
tactic=fight|skip
The forest contains 6 enemy patrols totaling 8 enemy=Wolves:veteran, 4 enemy=Sons_of_Svanir_(Greatsword):veteran, 2 enemy=Sons_of_Svanir_(Axe):veteran, 2 enemy=Sons_of_Svanir_(Bow):veteran, a enemy=Son_of_Svanir_(Hammer):veteran and a enemy=Son_of_Svanir_(Staff):veteran.
tactic=fight
At lower levels you can kill them for loot but they are often skipped though so be ready. Enemies move a lot so be ready to fight multiple patrol at the same time.
tactic=skip
Use mobility skills and condition removal to get through the forest. In a more coordinated group, you can also use stealth. Pay attention to your surroundings because enemies move a lot. If you die wait until someone gets to the end so you can resurrect at the checkpoint.
tactic=fight|skip
| Run into the cave and wait at the totem for rest of your team. The way gets blocked when someone engages the boss in the next room. You can use the totem to get in.
It's possible to get stuck when the way gets blocked so one player should enter while rest of the team uses the totem to get in.

name=enemy=Shaman_Lornarr_Dragonseeker:legendary
tactic=ranged|melee
His attacks inflict Frostbite stacks but they only last 15 seconds. At 10 stacks you get turned into an enemy=Ice:structure but lose all the stacks. If you get 8-9 stacks consider reaching 10 stacks on purpose to prevent lots of damage.
His most dangerous attack is Icy Breath which deals lots of damage and Frostbite in 10 cones. At all times be ready to dodge straight away from him if you get targeted. If you panic and run around you may get everyone killed.
tactic=melee
| If someone else gets targeted try to stay behind Lornarr's back so you don't get hit.
tactic=ranged
At all times keep some distance so you don't get hit by his basic melee hits.
tactic=melee
He also has a 3-hit melee chain. All hits inflict Frosbite and the third attack hits pretty hard. Stay behind his back if someone else has the aggro. If you have the aggro try to kite him at max melee range.
tactic=ranged|melee
Occasionally he kneels and turns into an ice shard. This causes Ice Spikes appear around the area and allows him to heal so focus it down fast. Ice Spikes hit after 2 seconds so you can just walk out of any red circles. Each Spike deals extreme damage and agony.
Every 50 seconds Lornarr teleports away to the cliff above which prevents you from attacking him. He casts multiple waves of Ice Spikes on the area. They appear first on the middle and then on the sides so move accordingly. They are quite easy to avoid as long as you keep your head cool. If you get in a bad spot just dodge or use a mobility skill.
After waves end you have a few seconds before Lornarr appears again. Use this time to heal, apply buffs and stack might.
If Lornarr dies to conditions while away use AoE looting to loot his corpse.
tactic=exploit
Not fully sure whether and how this works. Feel free to report if you have any success.
You need a mesmer with wiki=Portal. Team doesn't go in but instead jump onto the flag and then on the cliff on left. The mesmer places a portal where the team is standing, goes in solo and waits until Lornarr teleports up. Right before he comes back the mesmer places the portal end end and teleports back in time.
If done properly Lornarr should teleport to the team and just stand still without attacking. Lornarr may wake up and teleport back down. If that happens the mesmer just places another portal and repeats above.
Success of this may be based on portal placement and timing. Also team may be able to go attack him normally at start if everyone takes the portal. Also Lornarr may reset if mesmer doesn't get down fast enough.
tactic=guardian
You can drop wiki=Purging_Flames before the boss teleports back down so your team can stack might.
tactic=guardian
Provide Aegis against the autoattacks of the boss.
tactic=mesmer
Each Ice Spike count as a skill usage so try to apply lots of confusion before he teleports away.
tactic=mesmer
Ice Spikes won't hit clones so you can summon wiki=Phantasmal_Duelist on corners for 100% uptime.
tactic=elementalist
You can keep damaging him with wiki=Dragon's_Tooth even when he is away.
