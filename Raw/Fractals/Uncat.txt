name=Instability
tactic=normal|31-40
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Fumbler|Boon_Fumbler: When you dodge roll, you lose all your boons.
Losing both might and fury is a big damage loss so rely on other active defense. Enemies won't hit hard so take bit more sustain and tank attacks instead of dodging.
Don't dodge when running around so you don't lose swiftness.
tactic=normal|41-50
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_No_Pain,_No_Gain|No_Pain,_No_Gain: Enemies recieve random boons when you hit them for critical damage.
Possible boons are aegis, fury, might, protection, regeneration, retaliation and stability.
If eveyone has a high critical chance your party will generate a huge amount of boons. Boon removal can help but the gain is questionable if you sacrifice lots of damage.
Control skills are not effective because enemies will have stability. Condition damage is more effective because enemies will have protection. Take more sustain to counter damage from retaliation.
Bosses can't deal critical hits so fury has no effect. Bosses have a high power and a low healing power so might and regeneration don't have a big effect.
tactic=normal|51-60
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Last_Laugh|Last_Laugh: Enemies explode when killed.
Dodge?
tactic=normal|61-70
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Sluggish|Sluggish: The recharge time of skills you use is increased if you have a condition on you.
You will pretty much always have a condition on you so your skills recharge slower all the time. This will mess up any rotations so to stay effective make sure you know which skills are important to use on cooldown.
tactic=normal|61-80
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Afflicted|Afflicted: Enemies apply random conditions.
Be prepated to get immobilized or feared, especially when fighting enemy groups. Use stability if needed.
tactic=normal|71-90
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Fumbler|Boon_Fumbler: When you dodge roll, you lose all your boons.
Losing both might and fury is a big damage loss so rely on other active defense. Consider taking bit more sustain and tank weaker attacks instead of dodging.
Don't dodge when running around so you don't lose swiftness.
tactic=normal|81-100
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Boon_Thieves|Boon_Thieves: Enemies steal boons when they hit you.
Don't use retaliation or you will get everyone killed. Avoid using swiftness to make bosses easier to handle. Be careful with using quickness or resistance.
tactic=normal|91-100
wiki=Mistlock_Instability:_Social_Awkwardness|Social_Awkwardness: Nearby allies receive agony.
Don't stack as a full group. 4 stacks of agony kills you in 25 seconds even with a max agony resist. If you don't have max agony resist stay away from everyone else.

name=enemy=Harpy_Hunters:veteran
image=http://a.pomf.se/rmlcbz.webm
tactic=normal
You need to jump on platforms while killing or stealthing past harpies. Anti projectiles skills are extremely effective. At lower levels or with long-lasting stealth you can just run through them. There are several spots where your party can stop to re-stack stealth, providing you are still stealthed while you are stacking additional stealth.
On level 10 and above they shoot a glowing ball which launches anyone within its target area to their likely death. You should have access to a stability or immunity skill, a multiple block, or an in-place evade in order to deal with this attack. Jump-dodging to another platform, or simply moving to another platform early enough can also be effective.
Focus on keeping and getting people back alive. If someone falls and gets downed/defeated then regroup and get them up.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Wall_of_Reflection and wiki=Shield_of_the_Avenger to protect your team.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki="Stand_Your_Ground!" or wiki=Virtue_of_Courage against glowing balls if no other protection.
tactic=thief
Use wiki=Smoke_Screen and stack stealth with wiki=Cluster_Bomb. Skip harpies and use wiki=Shadow_Refuge when stealth is about to run out.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Feedback and Focus with wiki=Warden's_Feedback for good anti projectile coverage.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Mirror and wiki=Mantra_of_Concentration if you can't rely on your team.
tactic=necromancer
Use wiki=Flesh_Golem. Harpies have trouble hitting it.
tactic=elementalist
Use wiki=Swirling_Winds for protection against harpies.

name=Holding Area
tactic=normal
Break the enemy=Power_Generator:structure to free the enemy=Rabbit:champion, enemy=Bandit_Saboteur:veteran, enemy=Flame_Legion_Fire_Shaman:champion and enemy=Ettin:champion.
The rabbit has the lowest health so focus it first. Its special attack kills any target so burst it down fast. It doesn't matter if you get downed because you can easily rally from it.
The next squishiest target is the saboteur so focus her next. She throws poison at ranged targets which you can just ignore. At melee range she will either evade an attack and leave a red circle or put down a barrel. Both explode shortly after being placed, causing launch or a condition. Pay attention and move out of the area. Use control to keep her disabled.
Next, kill the Fire Shaman. He cycles between high-damaging ticking AoEs and short-range projectiles. Pay attention and move out of red circles if needed. Projectiles can be avoided by circling him, dodging or staying at range. If you are at range he may dash which deals very high damage at the end of the dash, and may grant him a fire shield if he dashes through his own AoE. Either dodge or run away from him if he dashes. One good melee-player can easily handle him. Just move out of the circles and keep circling.
The Ettin is quite tough to kill and has very annoying reach on his melee attack. You literally have to stand right behind it to avoid the attack; if unsure then dodge because it deals high damage. Whenever it glows you want to get out of melee-range. When club is above head he does some projectiles at melee-range. When club is behind back he will do a very large PBAoE.
Ettin also has a ranged attack which is used when he holds club behind back but without glow. He also breaks stuns, but only does so once every 60 seconds.
tactic=coordinated
Most coordinated groups designate a player to kite the Ettin around. The aggro of the Ettin can be manipulated by having higher toughness than other party members, as well as getting the first few hits in. A Guardian is an excellent choice for this role. Depending on the experience of the person kiting, and the experience of other party members, you may want to assign a player to get the aggro of the bandit and fire shaman at the start as well, to ensure they do not aggro to whoever is kiting the ettin. The aggro of the bandit and fire shaman is mostly based on who is currently hitting them.
Highly coordinated groups may want to kill both the Ettin and the Shaman with cleave. These groups will generally use an Earth Elemental to manage aggro.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Wall_of_Reflection and wiki=Shield_of_the_Avenger against the Shaman. Try predict the Ettin's attacks to reflect his projectiles.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Indomitable_Courage to counter the Bandit's bombs.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki="Retreat!" for the additional Aegis.
tactic=thief
Use wiki=Smoke_Screen to protect your team (especially against the Shaman). You may have to predict because of cast time.
tactic=mesmer
You can reflect damage done by Ettin's smaller PBAoE and his shockwave. Make sure to trait wiki=Temporal_Curtain aginst the Shaman.
tactic=elementalist
An Earth Elemental from wiki=Glyph_of_Elementals is excellent at holding aggro of the Ettin and Shaman.

tactic=normal
First kill or skip 1-3 enemy=Harpy_Hunters:veteran.
On the next set of stairs there are 4 beacons at the top. Each randomly shoots a projectile down the stairs. If you get hit you take damage (1-2 hits kill you), once you become downed you get teleported to start of the stairs.
You can easily avoid most of them by just moving left and right. You can dodge through them too but you should save one evade for the end. Near the top it's really hard to react fast enough so just dodge. You can also use long lasting blocks, immunities or projectile defense.
If you have trouble you can use the slope on the left side as a media=uncat_pulsing_safe.jpg|safespot (especially useful near the end).
After stairs there are 3 consoles. You need to activate them all within ~5 seconds to disable beacons. Activating a console prevents movement for ~5 seconds. You can still move and activate other consoles with blinks and shadowsteps. However, don't waste utility skill cooldowns if there are people nearby to help deactivating the consoles.
tactic=elementalist
wiki=Magnetic_Wave, wiki=Obsidian_Flesh, wiki=Mist_Form and wiki=Arcane_Shield, they all grant short invulnerability to those projectiles.
tactic=guardian
You can use wiki=Shield_of_Wrath and wiki=Shelter for additional blocks.
tactic=guardian
You can place wiki=Wall_of_Reflection at the very top of the stairs to prevent any projectiles from going down. Be careful, as if you place it too early, the reflected projectiles will go back up the stairs, and make things much harder for your team.
tactic=thief
You can run up a bit and use wiki=Dagger_Storm to allow whole party get safely through.
tactic=bug
There is a checkpoint at top of the stairs. Fractal will get stuck if you kill enemy=Old_Tom before triggering it. Checkpoint can be bypassed by blinking over it so have at least one player run normally.

Name=enemy=Old_Tom:champion
tactic=ranged|melee
Don't aggro Tom until everyone is ready and you have done the necessary preparations. Once the combat starts, poison gas will fill the room which will kill everyone quickly. You can activate a console behind Tom to ventilate the gas. Ventilation lasts 30 seconds.
At level 10 and above you have to power up side batteries in order to activate the console. Batteries can be powered up by bringing a "Tear of Dwayna" to them. When they run out you have to refill them before being able to use the console again.
Stay at sides of the room to avoid aggroing Tom. Power up batteries and gather several tears in front of both batteries. This allows you to quickly refill them. DO NOT touch the main console before starting the combat and getting hit by poison or it won't have any effect.
Also decide who uses the console and who fills left or right battery. Ranged players are more suitable for this but melee players can do it as well. In any event, be ready to improvise as players may get downed.
Most of the time Tom will be spinning which shoots unblockable projectiles in all directions. Try to stay behind other players so you won't get hit. If not possible, stay at high range to reduce amount of projectiles hitting you.
tactic=ranged
| Try to stay behind other players so you won't get hit. If not possible, stay at high range to reduce amount of projectiles hitting you.
tactic=melee
| Try to stay behind other players or pets so you won't get hit. You can also stay inside Tom to prevent getting hit. It needs precise positioning or you will take lots of damage so consider taking a backup immunity skill.
tactic=ranged|melee
When Tom stops he may use two different attacks. If he points his arm he will shoot a pulling projectile. Otherwise he will shoot a bouncing projectile. Dodge/block at both cases.
tactic=melee
| If you are standing inside him don't dodge or you have to position yourself again.
tactic=ranged|melee
When poison gas fills the room either finish off Tom or power up batteries and use the console.
tactic=elementalist
wiki=Earth_Elemental from wiki=Glyph_of_Elementals is very tanky and survives a long time. You can stay behind it.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Wall_of_Reflection against the few projectile attacks that Old Tom uses.
tactic=warrior
Use wiki=Defiant_Stance to tank poison and Tom for very good healing. Also useful when trying to get inside him.
tactic=coordinated
For coordinated groups with middling DPS, don't bother gathering extra tears. Power up the batteries, aggro Tom and activate the console, then burst tom down.
For coordinated groups with high DPS, stack behind an Earth Elemental, a bear pet, or a necromancer that is prepared to tank his spin.

name=enemy=Harpy_Hunters:veteran
image=http://a.pomf.se/tctiik.webm
tactic=normal
Again more harpies. Use same tactics as at the start.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Wall_of_Reflection and wiki=Shield_of_the_Avenger to protect your team.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki="Stand_Your_Ground!" or wiki=Virtue_of_Courage against glowing balls if no other protection.
tactic=thief
Kill first few harpiers and then Use wiki=Smoke_Screen and stack stealth with wiki=Cluster_Bomb. Skip harpies and use wiki=Shadow_Refuge when stealth is about to run out.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Feedback and Focus with wiki=Warden's_Feedback for good anti projectile coverage.
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Mirror and wiki=Mantra_of_Concentration if you can't rely on your team.
tactic=necromancer
Use wiki=Flesh_Golem. Harpies have trouble hitting it.
tactic=elementalist
Use wiki=Swirling_Winds for protection against harpies.

name=enemy=Raving_Asura:champion
tactic=normal
The fight gets very easy with lots of anti projectile skills. The Asura constantly shoots 3 homing projectiles, and each projectile inflicts agony. If you have to dodge, dodge in towards the Asura to break the other projectiles.
Four golems will activate. First, they will activate one-by-one, and once all have been defeated individually they will all activate simultaneously.
First you have to kill enemy=Snuggles:veteran. He either spins and shoots rockets at everyone or throws an area field which stuns when passing through.
Then you have to kill enemy=Mr._Mittens:veteran. He does decent damage with melee attacks. Dodge when he starts spinning to prevent getting pulled.
The next one is enemy=Professor_Mew:veteran. He mostly spins and debuffs people. If you stand near people with different buffs you will take some damage each second. At higher levels, if your team lacks sustain or DPS, try to interrupt his spin to avoid getting debuffed. He also has a melee attack.
And lastly enemy=Baron_von_Scrufflebutt:veteran. He is actually fairly dangerous with unblockable projectiles. His normal attack shoots 2 rockets at few people. At end of spinning he will shoot 2 rockets at everyone. Use Control skills and dodge.
Once Scrufflebutt is dead all the golems activate. Focus Scrufflebutt. Mittens is then the most dangerous, however killing him gives 66% damage reduction to all golems. If he doesn't feel like a threat then leave him last. Kill Snuggles and then Mew (killing gives golems regeneration). It can be very beneficial to group to golems up, either while they have activated individually, and/or when they activate together.
tactic=exploit
One player (with high toughness) may aggro and pull Asura away. You can easily kite it around a nearby column with just swiftness. Pull him back before your team kills last golem or it may reset.
Any golems killed after they all wake up get scaled back to level 1 making them extremely easy to kill (please verify).
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Wall_of_Reflection and wiki=Shield_of_the_Avenger against Asura's agony.
tactic=guardian
Use wiki=Binding_Blade to pull golems (especially when all activate).
tactic=guardian

tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Temporal_Curtain to pull golems (especially when all activate).
tactic=mesmer
Use wiki=Feedback and Focus with wiki=Warden's_Feedback for good anti projectile coverage.
tactic=necromancer
Use wiki=Spectral_Grasp to pull a golem.
tactic=thief
Use wiki=Scorpion_Wire to pull a golem.
tactic=thief
Use wiki=Smoke_Screen on top of the golems to blind them and provide anti projectile.
